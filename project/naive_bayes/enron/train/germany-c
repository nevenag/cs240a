The sale to PSE&G is in the New York book.  Judy is trying to get Transco to bill PSE&G directly for the demand charge.  We are still waiting to hear from Transco.

A physical forward deal with the reimbursement amount entered as an external fee in Sitara.  PSE&G would be buyer and TP-2 is seller (assuming this is a TP-2 deal).    What is the term of this deal?  Is commodity reimbursed also? Please confirm desk , provide details and I will enter the deal.  

Thanks,
Brenda

I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet.  The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.  How should we put this in Sitara.  I'm showing a transport demand charge on the capacity deal ticket.  How do we get the money back from PSE&G?

I am requesting a payment to Dominion Oklahoma (aka Louis Dreyfus) in the amount of $10,334.67.  This payment is for gas that flowed in Feb 2002 to the City Of Tallahassee.  According to Max Doner, ENA billed Tallahassee for the incremental volumes and Tallahassee paid for the gas.

Doug, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.  I will get the wire request from settlements, attach the supporting documents, get Ed's signature, and leave it with Susan.  I assume Susan will pass it on to one of you after she approves it.  Is that how the process works these days?

Subject:	Transportation notes for Feb

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

Guess what?  The house is unsured through July 21st or 24th or something like that.  I went digging through the papers last night and found it.  Guess who the Goober was that paid it last year???? me.

What I don't have are papers on the Silver Leaf resort thingy.  I mean I don't have a stitch.  That's ok - I mailed them a letter yesterday.  I'm going to try to get a gazillion bucks for it and leave you guys high and dry!   Whoooo hooo - Brazil (because of the ladies) here I come!!!!!!!!!!

Movies I want to see - Swordfish (John Travolta), The Mummy II, and a new Jet Li (kung fu dude) movie.

I'm still looking for a bay boat fella's - about 17-19 ft long with a 70-115hp motor.  I'm willing to spend up to $6,000.00.

   After quickly looking at invoices since Jan 2000, it appears the
   majority of
   the problems started to occur in early 2001. There are only small
   rounding
   differences occurring in 2000. It also looks like there were several
   months
   where MCV overpaid the Enron invoice to comply with the contract price.

The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).  I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price.

Ruth, you and I are chatting about this today I hope.

Kam, I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month.  I don't know if you need to be involved or not.

Chris,
We just require August and September, we already have July.
Would it possible to get the differential number before Wednesday? Our Accounting group requires this number for invoicing and they are a few weeks late with their August invoice and require the differential immediately.
Please let me know,
Thanks,
Nicole

Sorry about the delay.  I'm starting to look at this again.  I know you need August and September.  Did you say you also need July?  

I don't know if Canada makes any money off this deal but my book is taking a beating.  Ruth Concannon and I are meeting Wednesday to discuss this deal.  There are some other things going on with this deal that she is aware of.  I should have your prices by them.

Thanks

Nicole, I have the Boston Gas confirmation letter.  Thanks.

Kimat, are you familiar with the Boston Gas worksheet Dick Jenkins would update to calculate the Tenn Z6 city gate price?  It wasn't very big, and Dick would have me verify the Iroquois and Tenn transport variable cost.

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Do my prepays to Reliant for gas fall under your exception comment below even though they are not same day payments?
 
I can prepare my weekly cash request for swing gas with 2 days notice. I will just need to maintain a bigger cash balance with Reliant - probably about $20,000 more than what I've been keeping.  Let me know what your preference is.
 
I have 2 important payments (estimate of $2.1 mill) going out next Tuesday that are on Phil's Cash Forecast worksheet but I won't know the price until late Friday afternoon - usually this only happens during bid week and I hope this qualifies as an exception (let me know about this one too).  I actually prefer to see the price in print the day after NYMEX rolls off.   I will also be hounding you several times next Tuesday afternoon just to make sure these payments go out on time.

Subject: Manual Wire/Check Requests


Folks,
 
Starting Monday, 4/22/02, manual wire requests will have to go through the Cash Management Committee (CMC) the day before payment.  This means that the request forms and accompanying support documentation will have to be signed by the appropriate signatories of the business unit (BU), the BU CAO and the BU Head and delivered to myself (3-6337) at EBN 714a or Drew Kanellopoulos (3-9424) the day before the CMC meeting.  For example, if you need a wire sent on Wednesday, 4/24/02, you would need to deliver the request to us by the end of the day on Monday, 4/22/02 so the request could be reviewed at the 4/23/02 CMC meeting.  Check requests should be delivered three days in advance.
 
The only exceptions to this process will be items such as same day payment for prepay commodities.  
 
We appreciate you helping us relieve the incredible stress on the system to get payments more efficiently and please pass this on to anyone I have missed.
 
Regards,
Doug

I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES.  Maybe CES should just be you??  AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if he is aware of any items not in Sitara.  But Ernie should have the whole CES picture nailed down.  I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and we not be involved.  I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email.

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
	Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

Subject:	FW: Sonat Park & Loans and Sale to Sonat

These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing an additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.



Chris's notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

Scott is your main man - I guess.  I don't know if he is going to keep doing it or if he's going to hire an analyst.  I think Susan will be doing Texas Eastern.  Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on Tuesday.  I may be going Tues afternoon.  

When do you leave Houston?

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

Chris,
 
So do I pay the invoice or not.  I'm a little confused from all the emails.  Please advise.  Thanks.

Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

Chris,
I work with Richard in the Chicago office.  I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston.  Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC.  The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled?  With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.

I'm familar with the item. It sounds like enovate should pay it if it is enovate access. 
Is this taken care of or do I need to call someone to pay it?  Let me know

No I am not.  Donna Grief called me on Monday concerning this and I told her we would need Commercial's blessing and then approval by the cash committee.  I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.  I'm not really sure what group should handle it.  Is there an invoice that you can get to me so that I can have it as backup support for the cash request?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate. 
I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?
Thanks

Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

You really don't care about my back do you?????   Its doing ok.  Went to Florida with my brother last week.  Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at Disney.  Enjoyed both very much.  That was my first Disney trip and it was pretty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though.

Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.   And YOU ARE CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.

Hey.. how's it going??

How's your back??? How was Easter???

I may come down for the TCO/Gulf meeting in May. Have to get the blessing of
my boss first.

Who is doing TCO pool??? The screen says John Hodge... he is really a nice
guy.

Is John (can't remember last name)... TCO appalachian guy from CES... still
at Enron?? Do you have his number?? I've been given the order to start
finding appal gas... what a joy. I thought I would give Jim Javins a call
too.

Hope all is well for you.

The plant was faxing this to Enron for them to determine gas scheduling. Since I have become more involved, I don't think the plant needs to fax this over to you/Justin/Kevin any longer.

If you agree, I will inform the plant.

Ed, this gas was nominated on an IT contract into a pool on NGPL.  I am unable to identify the gas after that so its difficult for me to tell if the estate benefited.  Let me know what you want to do at this point.

Thanks

Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment.  The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted.  If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell
him.  This was an ENA deal.

>     Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00
from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001
(sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would "file a claim for
administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all
other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the
close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it
appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.

The invoice for $3,151,4550.05 is on SAP 3000012785

I found a payment from Duke Energy Field Services to settle storage fees due post bankruptcy dated 3/229/02.  These funds are on SAP 3000006586 in the amount of $2,735,550.05 - short from the invoice of $416,000.00

I have screen prints on each and will bring them to you and turn over to the appropriate party.

Priscilla was asking me if we ever paid for the Centanna storage that we sold to Duke Energy Field Services, LP.

I see that deal 1203368 was entered in Sitara on April 1, 2002 by Joe Parks.  The deal is a sale of 1,006,885 dth to Duke Energy Field Services at $3.13 on 3/30/02.  This is showing up in A/R as an outstanding receivable and Priscilla is wondering if the cash may be sitting in another account or different Duke entity.

Any ideas?

We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.

Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.  Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.

These are my notes on flowing gas.  Tetco will be the problem pipeline.  I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it.  I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00.  I'm using the following formula

	MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price 

They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem.  It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.  I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.  If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.

Who knows what volumes are going to be?

Subject:	Transportation notes for Feb

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

I was getting an error messge until I downloaded something from the IOL Setup & Help tab.  
Now, I go to http://www.iroquois.com/igts/info/section-frame.html and select "Transportation" at the top of the screen.  
Then I select "Customer Activities" from the left side of the screen.
And this is where I used to get an error message, now I just get a small symbol - looks like some sort of "flash" plug in is not loaded.

LoConte and Liz Danehy about the release.  Haven't heard back from them.  I
told them they can nom on the released quantity.

Chris,
I left a message with our Credit folks, but I'm not sure how long it will
take to get a response.  Both the manager and the main person we work with
in that group are out today.  The manager's voice message said he'd be in
the ofc tomorrow.

Hector,
Chris called today to ask what we would require from Enron so that they
could set up an IT contract on which they would do only pool-to-pool
transfers, with volumes up to 40,000 dt/day.  Since we can't stop shippers
from doing billable transactions on IT contracts, I assume credit will still
require some sort of financial backing, such as cash up front.  I left a
message for Ken Newberry, but it doesn't look like I'll hear back from him
before I leave today.  Please follow up with Ken this afternoon if you have
time or with Leldon tomorrow.

Chris' number is 713-853-4743

Same thing as yesterday.  I requested a wire in the amount of 244.20 (2000 dth x $.1221 per dth) which is for gas flow on ENA's IT contract #2891 on 2/6/02.  I negotiated this deal with Michelle in the bid room.  You should have received this yesterday afternoon.

Chris,

I am faxing copies of Jan. 2002 and Feb. 2002 Sonat invoices to Maria.  I do see the balances on #1 and #2 on the Jan. 2002 statements.  It looks like we received 77,292 mmbtus back on contract PSNG2194 leaving a balance of 188,949 on deal #1222.  There was no activity for Jan. 2002 on contract PAL1001,deal 1424.  We were charged a total of $19,043.73 for the remaining volumes in storage ($.00305 per day).  Please let me know if there is anything else that I need to do.  

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: Sonat Park & Loan

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

If you guys have files where the invoices are, let me know and I'll just go through the files myself and forget the copies.

Frank, I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email.

As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, "the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great" .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.


However, we do support intra-day capacity release.

Attached is a presentation from Dynegy that answers the question of " Will intra-day capacity recalls support reliability for the Provider of Last Resort in a deregulated market ?"  Dynegy seems to be saying "no".  KeySpan is the LDC that is suggesting that the POLR ( in their minds, KeySpan ) needs intra-day capacity recall rights to serve the market reliably.  Another question comes from this as to our larger business.  That is, Will intra-day capacity recall rights effect our business favorably or unfavorably as a whole ?  Chris and Maureen, I am interested in you thoughts on this asap.

Thanks

Subject:	Update Meeting

Good morning-

Can we get together tomorrow afternoon to go through recent developments in the Tetco and Sonat 637 cases, and the Transco rate case?  Other than Bob's staff meeting from 2-3, I'm clear all afternoon so please let me know if you're free.

Is there anyone else over there I should invite?

Thanks
Suzanne

I think this is funny.  I believe Enron laid off some incredibly talented people.  Gloria might like this.

These days, its easier for our legal department to draft or approve a new GISB than to find any of the existing documents.  The attached document is for Enron North America Corp.  David is going to see if they can use it.

If your legal department approves, please print 2 originals, fill in the Sempra information, sign it, and send it to me.

Thanks

Natural Gas Futures End Higher

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX closed higher yesterday as traders
sought to cover their short positions due to a feeling that the market was
oversold following the steep decline of the last several days. The June
contract climbed
$0.04 to $4.279 per MMBtu. June rose $0.039 to $4.353 per MMBtu. The market
was basically just marking time until the AGA releases the latest storage
injection figures this afternoon. The AGA is expected to announce an
addition to storage of about 100 Bcf. A somewhat lower injection could spark
a rally because the market has already discounted a triple digit build.
However, an injection of over 115 Bcf could send the market to $4.00 in a
hurry. A year ago, stocks for the same week rose 58 Bcf, and the five-year
average injection is 61 Bcf. Since the AGA began reporting storage data, the
highest ever recorded was 78 Bcf in 1998. If current weather models hold up,
the Midwest and Texas will escape much of the summer's hottest temperatures,
and right now, temperatures are mild across most of the nation. Look for
technical support at the $4.20 level, and resistance is expected at $4.40.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada generally slipped
$0.10  $0.15 per MMBtu yesterday, except in the west where most spot prices
rose due to hot weather. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub
dropped $0.12 to $4.21 per MMBtu.

Enron's Lay Calls for Open Access to Transmission Grid

    Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, says that generators should have easier
access to the power grid. Lay spoke after receiving the US Energy
Association's 2001 US Energy Award, saying that today we don't have open
access to the transmission grid, and we could get more power into the West
if we had open access. He says the FERC should open up the power grid
throughout the nation so generators no longer have to pay a series of
separate fees to move electricity from one region to another. He also says
FERC has the authority to open up the power grid in the same way that
natural gas pipeline transmissions work. It's clear we've under-invested in
energy infrastructure in the last 10 to 15 years, and it's going to take a
few years to correct that.

Kinder Morgan and Calpine Offer 2 Open Seasons
for Sonoran Pipeline

    Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Calpine have announced that two open
seasons have begun and will continue through June 1st on the recently
announced Sonoran Pipeline.  A binding open season is being held on Phase
One of Sonoran - which would run from the San Juan Basin in New Mexico to
the California border - to give shippers the opportunity to commit to firm
capacity on the pipeline.  A non-binding open season is being held
simultaneously on Phase Two of the project - which would extend the pipeline
from the California border to the San Francisco Bay area - to give potential
shippers the opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firm
capacity to California delivery points.  Sonoran has received a binding
commitment from Calpine Energy Services for 400,000 Dth per day on Phase One
and a non-binding commitment for 500,000 Dth per day for Phase Two. The
proposed pipeline will be a 1,030-mile, high-pressure interstate natural gas
pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in
California and is projected to be in-service date by the summer of 2003.

Power Suppliers to Meet with California Governor

    Executives from energy suppliers are meeting with Californias governor
today, and several are willing to discuss concessions that include price
limits on power sold within the state. Last week the governor said he would
seek to force the suppliers to accept reduced payment for billions of
dollars owed by the states utilities. In the face of a state investigation
into alleged market manipulation, some generators are willing to discuss
limits on prices for some electricity sold to the state. Williams says it is
prepared to support temporary price controls that would extend through the
summer of 2002. Williams is also willing to discuss a range of possible
alternatives for repayment of past debts owed to it. Reliant will reiterate
an earlier offer to sell some electricity to the state at $20 per MWh if the
buyer will pay for the natural gas to generate the power. Duke Energy has
proposed accepting less than full payment for power sold to the state in
return for an end to state and federal investigations into the prices they
charged. Duke, Enron, AES, Dynegy, Mirant, El Paso Energy, Reliant, and
Williams will all send executives to Sacramento to the meeting.

BULLS CAUTIOUS
In spite of slip sliding natural gas prices, analysts are still cautiously
bullish. There seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish cause
with the prospects of hot summer weather looming."This is a weak market, but
I think that below $4.60 you have to anticipate the return of industrial
demand. It's really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edge
off the current large injections. Over the past month, the market has gone
through a major change. Production has increased, storage  is higher, and
the injection last week at 102 BCF was the largest since June of 1998,' says
George Ellis, broker analyst with BNP Paribas, New York. "I was skeptical of
 the whole concept of demand erosion, but it's obviously real and when you
combine that with an increase in production, the supply demand balance
becomes clear. There is potentially more room to the downside, but the wild
card is weather and if that kicks in, prices could move sharply higher. If
prices fell to $4.38 then that would be a reason to put on another 25%
hedge. As long as we're holding these prices I think there's a good chance
prices will rally higher. I'm cautiously bullish. I would not be an
aggressive seller," he said.

Trenton/Blackriver production found in the state, was in a well drilled in
1962 by Tidewater Oil Company adjoining our property. We need an industry
partner. Geophysicist report and other information available.  The 85000
acres would also make a great gas storage field.

We also have another small storage field for sale near the new Trenton
Wells.

Blackouts Hit California Again

    California residents suffered through a second day of rolling blackouts
yesterday as temperatures soared, driving demand ahead of supply. The
California ordered that as of 3:10 PM the state's utilities must cut 400 MW.
Blackouts had been forecast by the ISO since early in the morning with the
heat coming at a time when many power plants are still off-line for
maintenance. The Los Angeles Department and Power, was as usual was excluded
from the blackouts. The LADWP is not under the ISO's control and has more
than enough generation to meet its demand. The ISO said demand was running
about 1,000 MW above Monday's levels. Earlier Tuesday, the ISO had projected
blackouts could be ordered before noon, but the return to service of two
500-kilovolt lines operated by BC Hydro meant more power was able to flow
south. About 700 MW produced by small suppliers, known as Qualifying
Facilities, are currently offline because they have not been paid. The hot
temperatures are likely to continue today, with the threat of more
blackouts.

I am micro-managing this deal and I don't want it to catch you by surprise.  If you look at my schedule for March, you will see that it is possible for ENA to have a negative cash balance with Reliant before I make the Thursday prepay based on the daily spike in prices.  I get the estimated prices from Jim.  Do you want me to make a prepayment on Wednesday or are you comfortable with the regular Thursday prepayment?  I need to know by tomorrow morning.  I have to request prepayments the day before the wire goes out.

Thanks

I, of course MUST have my lunch hour.  But after that is over, say 1:00
or so, lets get together.  Shemin, you set the time.  Wade, bring some
of those letters you are talking about down below.

Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.
Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd?? and terminate the pools without
Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.  You and Patricia can
decide if you want to come.

Thanks

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Just so you don't forget me.  I know its early but I'm interested in coming back.  I'm sure you don't know what you will need until after we find out what happened today.  Tom Martin was asking me if I would be interested in going to the Texas Desk to take Daren Farmer's place, Daren is going to AEP.  I told him I would like to talk to you about the East Desk first.  Tom would like an answer by Monday.

Let me know.

Thanks

Kimat, I just took the volumes to 0 effective 10/1/2001 on deal 815952.  Should we just delete the lines on the deal ticket for dates after 10/1/2001?

Effective 10/1/2001, the primary desk for transport on TGT will be TP1.

Actually I am.  The little woman and the little bundle of joy both sleep in the other room.  Makes it easy for me.  My woman is trying to breastfeed.  I can't tell you how stressfull that has been.  There needs to be a class for guys on how to best support their "Woman" after birth.

Ahhh, my little bundle of joy is cute though.  And her mom lives in town and spends a lot of time over at out place which works out great.  We can go out for dinner pretty easy.  A lot of people don't seem to have that.  Judy said she would baby sit but it's not worth the trip to the edge of the earth in Katy.

Guess what.  I have the deal numbers in my notebook packed in  a box - but Ed McMichael said we are not going to flow this gas until March.  I think he also said he is trying to resurrect the Con Ed deal - which is probably similar to the Lilco deal with respect to the pipelines it flows on.

Transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the East.  They assign the shipper a specific meter for that pool and you use your IT contract to nominate pool to pool stuff.  

I DID NOT CHANGE THAT OL CAPACITY TICKET BUT I THINK I WILL.  I'VE GOT TIME!!!!!!!!!

chrissy,
what is the lilco deal you are referring to?  are we currently noming this?  can't find anything in unify that shows that we are.  

what deal on transco would you need an it contract for?  

also, did you go and change the capacty ticket to reflect the release of capacty?  I'm not sure how to reflect it, but the ticket numbers
are 1190900, and 1190720.  I can do this for you if you tell me how it should be reflected.

Subject:	Transportation notes for Feb

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

Moved the prepay to Wednesday.  The amount is $42,000.00 due to the spike in pirces.

Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

Chris:

The offer is now on our Iroquois OnLine system and has an offer number of 50153.  The only thing I've added is Liz Dennehy's email address which I have as ldenehy@keyspanenergy.com.

Also the offer term end date is 4/1/2002 at 09:00.  If I left it at your 3/31/2002 09:00 then they wouldn't be able to nominate it on the very last day of the month.  Please let me know if that is ok.  Thanks.

I see job #1154 (Origination - Wholesale) on the job posting board.  I am going to apply for it online (hopefully today).  I thought you said yesterday that there are two postings for your area.  Do you know if it has been posted yet or are you using job #1154 to fill both positions?

We creat a new sheet each month.  And the the last 2 digits are the month - "05" = May get it get it get it?  Anyone can pull this file up.  You need a password to open the file and make changes.  The password is the file name.  I just didn't want people to make changes by accident (which I have done myself).

Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday.  On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.

Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.

Thanks

MCV faxed their May 2002 requirements to Kevin Brady.  MCV is requesting 6,800 dth per day on Trunkline (MCV I deal) and 15,000 dth per day on Trunkline, ANR, and Panhandle (MCV II deal).

I assume we are still physically serving the MCV I deal for 6,800 dth for May 2002.  Please let me know.

Does anyone need to see the notices from MCV?  I am going to send a copy for Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and put a copy in our contract files here.

Richard James Taylor was born on Jan 15th.  He weighed 7 lbs 11 ozs.  Jim would like to meet for lunch, HIS TREAT, one day.  Of course he doesn't want to meet me, he wants to see Judy P.  But the boy is smart, he knows that the best way to see Judy P. for lunch is to invite me.  See there, you are still a benefit to me.  So how about Thursday?

Wade called Eric about someone wanting us to cancel a contract then Wade said there are still lots of producers putting gas on our contracts.  I was working on something else and I just asked Wade to send me a worksheet of what he was talking about.  Wade actually called Eric.

Do you want to work with Wade Price on the Appalachian suppliers on CGAS?  I think we are still getting gas because contracts have not been terminated or something like that.  It will probably be tedious but it doesn't matter to me.  Just let me know.

You gave me 2 invoices for CNR that are not on your April 2002 payment worksheet.

Producer	Volume		Amount
J E Harris	815		$260.80
Carol Littleton	748		$239.36

Should I toss these 2 invoices or should they be included in the list?

I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?
 
Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

  In the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system.  Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and Enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.

Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA.  I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket.  I'll see what I can do.

Nothing is paid to or agreed with Bridgeline until we reach resolution and get approval to proceed.  Have we received these in past months?  What have we done with those?

If it does not create a confirmation, what does it mean to approve this ticket?

Subject:	Bridgeline Invoicing

ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.  In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms).  Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.  Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691.  This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer.  The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00.  Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice.

Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket?  According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.

Hi team.  I'm going to set myself up as the Navigator administrator for Enron North America unless someone else wants to do it.  We use Navigator for activity on Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf, Crossroads, and KO Transmission.  I think we also use Navigator to download the invoices.

I'm going to kill all the ID's shown below except mine.  Should I set up anyone else with an ID?

Hey Chris:

Below you will find a list of current Navigator Ids' registered under Enron
North America

NAV1279   GARCIA                CLARISSA              (713)853-7179)


Are there any other Enron companies that you need to look at as far as
Navigator ID's?  If so I can forward that info to you.

Below are two attachments; one for the new admin (you) and one to remove
exiting Nav ids or to add new Nav ids'.

(See attached file: ADD_CHANGE_ADMINISTRATOR_FORM.doc)            (See
attached file: ADD_REMOVE_USER_FORM.doc)


Since Robert Allwein is the current, can you get his signature on the
Change Adm form?  If you can GREAT!.....if not then the form must be
signed by a Notary.  Then you can go ahead and sign the forms to remove any
ids.

You can call me at  1 800 628 4867.  I really appreciate your help in
getting this account cleaned up.

Thanks,

Vickie

HEY!!!  What's up in your life?  My woman is getting bigger every day.  I wonder if this little sucker is going to look anything like Duff?  We've been living in sin together since the last week of Feb.  So far so good but I do like my solitude.

I'm thinking about buying a new car.  BUT I'm almost always thinking of buying a new car.  I drove all the toyota suv's the chevy suv's, nissan and ford.  My favorite out of the pack is the ford explorer - GO FIGURE.  ITs more comfy for my tush!

I purchased 6172 day from the Canadian desk at NFUL Niagara (deal 802218).  The price is NX1 plus $.23.

The buyer is East TP3.  The seller may be wrong.

Please forward to Mr. Storey's book admin.

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
	Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?
 
Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

It is over with.  The addendum may or may not be signed and its a seperate document and I will personally pay for all legal cost incurred regarding the addendum.  But the other documents are in route to me, i get it, i sign it, you and donny sign it, i send it back, waaaala!!  The lawyer told that once the documents are filed with the courthouse then everything becomes ours (I don't call the lawyer anymore because her time is "billable")  I don't think its that simple though.  What do you think?

So what are you doing this weekend?

Hey,

If some where down the line they want to excerise this right, then we worry
about it.  I say we worry about it for the next  five years then let whom ever
has  a problem with this hire a lawyer for the rest.   What you say BUB.  Lets
just get this over with and move on with life.   See Ya.

Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed
by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a
termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't
include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting
with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original
agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this
lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW.

Pete,  I'm following up the voicemail I left you this morning.
 
In our initial discussions you indicated we could do business under an existing GISB agreement between Enron North America and Reliant.  However, our legal department believes all of our GISB contracts with Reliant have been cancelled/terminated.  Attached is a standard GISB agreement for your review.  I understand that you need to send this to your legal department to include any special provisions that may be necessary.   
 
Please call me at 713-853-4743 or Eric Boyt at 713-345-7754 and let me know if Reliant Energy Services is willing to trade under this agreement.
 
Thanks
Chris Germany
Manager, Gas Trading

Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

Unify shows some production in November and December on CNG Appalachia.  Small producer.  We owe $539.35 for November and $338.40 for December.  Unless there is value we are not paying December production and of course we are not paying November.  The points on CNG are #4281001 and $4371101.

I just spoke with Theresa Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.

Thanks

I'm taking off Friday.

yes, I am basically handling any "old" wholesale business which for now includes the FGT/Citrus, Lonestar and some Enron Compressor stuff on TW.  I do have a Sitara ticket that we are updating for the sale to TXU, just let me know the price and I'll update it.  I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.  Is Joe Parks leaving or something, why are you doing all this stuff now?

FYI:  I call it the Cleburne Plant and it is at the same point as it was for the first 3 days of the month.  The scheduler over there calls me every morning to verify.

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

thx

Sure.  I'll be there Monday morning.  Ingrid woudl probably like it too.  What would you have me do?  

Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA.  Talk about a change in location.  I thought that was nice of him to offer though.

So what do you think?  Wait and see if there is any severance, maybe a job, or activly look for a new job?

The two attachments show all the contracts that are active for ENA per Columbia's system effective 12/01/2001 and 06/01/2002.  This might be handy to have when we talk to Steve today.  The file name tells you what effective date I used on the report.  The effective date is also shown in the upper right part of the report as well.  The column in the far left indicates which pipeline the contract is for; TCO is Columbia Gas and CGT is Columbia Gulf.



 


 

The attachments below show all the active contracts for Columbia Energy Services (CES) and Columbia Gas Marketing (CGM) for the same time frame.  ENA is agent for both of these companies.

Greg
We've chatted before but you may not remember me.  I'm currently working for the ENA Estate team and I need to purchase some Trunkline Ela gas for April.  Ruth Concannon suggested that I contact you but she didn't have your number handy.  I also have other buy/sells that come up from time to time as well.  Please let me know if you would be interested in selling us gas. 

Thanks

Daniel, these are the notes I took from Friday's floor meeting.


Dan Leff floor presentation on Friday March 22nd, 10:00 AM
came here 5 years ago, Mechanical enigeer, sold his business FMES in 1997 to EES and been with EES every since.

we have about 1,000 people left in wholesale and retail
about 800 people in support groups
we've lost about 7,000 people since Dec 2nd.

3 things
1.  where is the business now
we know where we are, where we are going, retention\
pooled wholesale and retail resources
figure out how to get the people together

we've completly revamped the sr management team
target recovery of $6 billion dollars for the estate team, this is not a book value or firesell value.
$3 bill in ENA, $1.4 EES  $600 mill enron canada.....so forth.
stan hortin   mike mcconnel looking at packaging deal and assets together to develope a new reorganized company.

2.
we are important, the people that is
all the difficult times are behind us
he understands our urge to leave
take a deep breath, think about how what you do will enhance career.

retention plan should be presented next week, will be filed next week with the bankruptcy court.
creditor's committee has approved the retention plan

plan brings substantial amount of money to bear 
jobs may change
email will go out next week detailing plan
management will talk to people before next friday about how the overall retention plan will impact us and our coworkers


Liquidation bucket - people settleing terminated positions, assets, primarily commercial oriented.  Commision type environment.
Retention Pool - cetain amount of money is paid on a qtrly basis.
Severeance plan - safety net for people not in retention or liguidation bucket.
anyone in severance plan will have their monies offset by any monies they recieve  on one of the other plans.

3.
personal message 
be positive
have some fun
get a bounce back in your walk
you can be part of fixing it
take next year or 2 years to learn and develope.

queston:  what is the goal of the company
we are selling books of business, assets, and substantial amount of backoffice work needs to be done to do the settlements.
we are not going to try and develope new business.

question:  org chart?
We should be developing one over the next few weeks.

came here 5 years ago, Mechanical enigeer, sold his business FMES in 1997 to EES and been with EES every since.

Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at Doyle on Transco.  I have devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.  Poke all the holes in it you want.

Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy

The higher of
St 65 Offer plus $.35
TCO Offer plus $.14

Good Luck

Per our conversation a few minutes ago, attached please find the revised Stipulation.  This document has been modified with the changes that were in the mark-up you faxed to Toni Donohue here a few hours ago.  I also deleted "subject to recall" based on our discussion, assuming you get approval for that revision.  You informed me that you would discuss this with your attorney.
Also, as I mentioned to you, we have faxed your mark-up to Melanie Gray at Weil Gotschal in Houston to keep her informed.  (Her voice mail says she's out of the office until Monday.)

Hey buddy, this is out of a Duke Energy newsletter.  I'll just give you the highlights.

Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of NiSource, INC.  MHP currently operates 2 facilities.  The Moss Bluff facility in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La.

I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.  I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline.

I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now.  This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract.  It is scheduled to come out on Sonat.  To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges.  But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.  I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.


We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.  I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.

Subject:	CGAS Park & Loan deals

We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.

Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.  Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.

Ilene Leahey is going to help print contracts from live-link.  She is from the local Andrews & Kurth office.  I have set her up at Julie Gomez's desk and she is using my id to print contracts.

She shouldn't need anything but if she does please help her. 

Thanks.

She is going to print all the Appalachian Producer contracts that she can pull up out of live-link from my master list.  I also asked Melissa if she could help and she said she would be glad too.  Let me know if that's ok.

Reliant Energy.  I would like to talk to Reliat if you want to do something with them.  I currently have a cash balance of $228,000 with Reliant.  We are going to send them and invoice for $156,000 for sales ENA made to Reliant.  That will leave me with about $71,000 and maybe we can do something to work it off.


Cinergy will not trade with Enron.  Robin Barbe's contact told her they would not trade with us regardless.

FYI

I just checked the Tenn EBB and it does not appear that Boston Gas is releasing the Net 284 space to anyone.  I also just got off the phone with Ivy at Iroquois, she is the capacity release lady.  She said she didn't think that Boston Gas has been using this space at all.

I'm trying hard not to call you and use up my phone call allowance this morning.  GOOD NEWS.  I'm reading an article on Yahoo and they use the word nebulous.

Enron is, in part, the deformed offspring of a move to deregulate markets. It played fast and loose in a nebulous world of finance that received scant attention from lawmakers.


I know what it means.  And this is only the second time I have ever seen this word used!!!!!!!

Gloria Barkowsky has access to Escript, but she is on vacation this week. I don't know if someone else in Volume Management has access (Rita??).  

Dominion used to send data files to us that, in addition to "current" month allocations and meter statements, may have included imbalance information.

Kathryn (EES Volume Management) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers  for EES.  Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department.  We may have to do that anyway.  I'm not sure what this report is called, I just know its on a 2 month lag.  I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB).  If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me.  If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.

Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this.  If the person that handled Dominion is gone, then I'll just go the "legal" route.

Thanks

Demand charges are showing up now.  We still have a problem with the 9th (4500 @ $5.445), this should not be on the invoice.  My Transco scheduler has informed me that they have taken the volume to 0 in Unify and that this item will need to be "actualized" 0 by volume management.  I don't know how that part works.

Dara, are you volume manangement??

Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

Chris,
I work with Richard in the Chicago office.  I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston.  Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC.  The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled?  With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.

No I am not.  Donna Grief called me on Monday concerning this and I told her we would need Commercial's blessing and then approval by the cash committee.  I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.  I'm not really sure what group should handle it.  Is there an invoice that you can get to me so that I can have it as backup support for the cash request?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate. 
I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?
Thanks

Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.

I told you to ask Shemin "What the hell is going on with Dominion?  What's the latest?".  Well that's what this is.  Never got me an answer on that now did you?  I'm betting you and Shemin were at the Waffle House smokin'  cig's, drinking coffee, and eating hash browns that were "covered" with cheese and filled with "chunks" of ham

Just wanted to let all of you know that there's going to be another wedding
in the future!

Brent and I got engaged on Thursday night.  He completely surprised me with
a beautiful ring and a nice dinner at Mark's after spending an hour at the
Museaum of Fine Arts.  We're planning to have the wedding in Tulsa next
March, but have not set a definative date yet.

It's been a wonderful few days and I'm slowly getting used to having jewerly
on that finger.  (After a few scratches, I must admit.)

I just thought everyone should know since I've been harrassed about this
event for quite some time now.  :)  Hope all is well everyone!

Angie

I didn't know if the Central Desk deals are under Central Desk or one of their many other books.  I think I just need Central, East, West, and Texas.

But, maybe you can help.  My request for the Central Desk needs Darron Giron's approval and he's not in the People Finder.  So he's either at UBS or he left the company.  Do you know who I should be approving that now?

Thanks

The spreadsheet for Nov. does not have any demand expense listed for Tetco. The Service P/L report shows demand cost on contracts 895829 and 895835, deal numbers 1146868 and 1146936.

Do you need to update spreadsheet?

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

thx

At the suggestion of Ed, I went ahead and sent Melissa a cookie bouquet for her whole family to enjoy.  If everyone gave $3.00 that

Scott, 

In reconciling imbalances with Somerset Gas Transmission Company, LLC, Volume Management has discovered two contracts that were assigned from CES.  If these are valid, we need to load beginning balances as of 12/31/99.

The contracts are as follows: 

Contract 
Number          Agent for               Type of Service Class           Rate Schedule   Beginning Balance 

3005            Dannic Energy Corp      Gathering       Interruptible   I               5,425 mmbtu 

3028            Thomas Leeper           Gathering       Interruptible   I               500 mmbtu 

I will also need a transport capacity ticket set up.  Please let me know if we should set these contracts up of not. 

Thanks,

FYI, I just bumped up the forecast for next week from $19,000 to $37,000 because Tallahassee took the swing gas for the weekend.  I've also put a manual date and time on my swing gas cash forecast worksheet.

A.K. is looking for the volumes and dollars on deals ENA has done since March 1, 2002.  I would appreciate if everyone would look at my worksheet and let me know if you are aware of something I have not included.

A.K.  I just includes the spot deals that we have done to support term deals or to liquidate storage/park & loan positions that we have.  As I said in my voicemail, you might also be looking for capacity release dollars as well.

That would be great if you could tell me.  I show we wired $22,500.00 at 12:00 PM on the 6th, and we should have wired $20,000.00 around 3:30 PM on the 8th.  I would be happy to include you on the schedule below that I email to Jim and Pete showing this activity.  Let me know.  You might let your accounting department know that we plan on wiring money to Reliant every Thursday, enough money to cover supply for the next 7 days.

Maybe we should have the transport books roll up into the ENA Upstream book - then us little transport folks could work with the wellhead desk instead of against you.  That way we could get credit for our knowledge even though it doesn't show up on the bottom line of our P&L.

I believe our new Tennessee rep is Sherry Glazebrook at 832-676-2635.  If she's no longer there then call Andy Armstrong in the bid room and he will find out who our rep is.  His number is 832-676-5120.  Anyone that answers the phone in the bid room should be able to tell us how our rep is.

Our rep at Iroquois is Robin Zaleski at 203-925-7274.

Subject:	RE: Sonat Park & Loan

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

See that means I'm like Patrick Swazzie in the movie Ghost.  He was way toooo macho to use the love word so he came up with an acceptable alternative.  But if I die and I come back to haunt you, I won't be using the word ditto.  I'll probably make reference to a Shetlon Pony.  That way you will know its me.

Why doesn't Enron promote from within.... same old story. It just took a
long time before EOL had the markets out there.

I leave Tuesday evening. There is a dinner Monday night... you should get an
invite... since Goodell has to do the family thing... as always.

doing it or if he's going to hire an analyst.  I think Susan will be doing
Texas Eastern.  Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on

Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer at Sonat (205-326-2007)
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Dec 2001 or Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001 that ENA has not paid for.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).

You are my hero buddy. 

And you think I should get married?   FYI  while everyone else has been stressed out about work, I've been focused (VERY STRESSED OUT) with more personal issues.  Every time I ask for some kind of sign, someone comes along and tells me I should get married.

Hmmmm.

In September, ENA agreed to purchase capacity from New Power on Transco.  The total demand charge should have been $9,000.00 on contract 4.0159.  New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it.  The actual demand charge billed was $270,000.00.  New Power agreed to reimburse ENA for the difference of $261,000.00.

ENA will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $270,000.00 and bill New Power $261,000.00 on deal 1110019.

Actually it is not a new truck.  Had 33,000 miles, Ram 2500 3/4 ton, 4 x 4,
360 Magnum Motor.  Infinity stereo, bucket seats, nerf bars, tool box, bed
liner, camper tow package, 5 speed manual.  Oh, it is dueled out through one
catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound.  Makes me want to
race!!!  I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well.  Now,
Debbie wants it.  I gave $16,900 + tax.  It is very clean and is Sandalwood,
Driftwood or something of that nature in color.  Almost silver.  I have to
pick up old gray over at Jerry's.  Debbie said, it is going to be hard on me
to sale my old dodge truck.  I said Yep, had that truck longer than I have
had most of my women.  I really need to engage brain before articulating!  I
am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before
rain.  One thing is for sure, the economy is not faltering on my account.
Dow Stock is back up over $33.  Hooray, hoorah!
Needs to go to $41 and then I will be happy.  I spoke with Gerald and he
said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad's place.  We need to
change the lock and place posted signs at the gate.  I may want to put some
steers or heifers up there.  I am going up soon and having the tractor
fixed.  Reggie said he will pay us soon.  He also still wants the tractor if
we can hold on to it.  First come, first serve.

When is the wedding?  We're set for 11/01/01.  Be sure to take your sweety
out on the balcony tonight and gaze at the full moon.  It was sure beautiful
coming up last night.  We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket
and watch for the space shuttle.  I had a couple of hickies on my neck the
day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns.  Just
jealous.

My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate
within the four year period.  She still has some sort of scholarship but I
am not for sure how much it pays.  She is going to be a kinesiologist,
sports injury therapist.  I think she just wants to be able to touch
football players legs.  She will be 20 on 11/03.  I am really proud of her.
Cindy said Jaime has grown up very much.
You should e mail her sometimes.  I am sure she would like to hear from you.
Jgerma5@aol.com.

At any rate, be careful and be safe.  You should have listened to Maw, as
long as you keep your mouth shut and your pants zipped, you will be alright.
Shucks, guess none of us three paid much attention to that.  Oh, Jeff
Sherrar has a new book out. Rise to Rebellion.
There were some pretty cool dudes back around 1774/76.  There will be two
volumes to this saga.  I am half way through the first and you can borrow it
when I am through.  I sure like his style of writing.  His books are always
hard to put down.

After the split Dow Stock there are 120 shares.

Keep Your Powder Dry!

What's happening?  I understand you have a brand new truck.  Must be
nice having money!!

I need 2 things from you.

	1.	I found the title to the 4 wheeler and I was going to
change it over to you name.  What do you think?  If that's ok, how do
you want your name to show up on 		the title and what
address should I use?

	2.	I'm getting ready to divy up the Dow stock.  How many of
Dad's shares do you have?

Last thing, send me a million dollars, I'm tired of working.

I've requested a $17,000.00 wire to be made tomorrow and we still have a cash balance of $54,820.00.

I'll be out of the office tomorrow so Kathy Kelly will be handling our activity.  Her number is 713-853-5858.

Thanks and have a good weekend.

Can you extend the following deal to 3/31/00?  This contract had a small amount of activity for 2/00 and 3/00.

Thanks,

I had most of the details yesterday morning, my fault for not responding.  And I also didn't clue into the 4/99 contract start date as well.

With Rita and Kevin's help, we have identified 4 deals for American Public Energy Agency

Deal #		Contract	End Date	Pipeline		Comment
310424		96026367	4/30/2011	NNG		Did not receive any gas for December 2001
310690		96012204	5/31/2008	NNG		Did not receive any gas for December 2001
936073		96021055	4/30/2011	PGEN		Need to see when physical flow stopped
936263		96021053	4/30/2011	SCAL		Need to see when physical flow stopped.

Rita, you ran the Deal Volume Tracking report for Dec 2001 and you found the PGEN and SCAL deals.  Would you please run a report for Nov 2001 just to make sure that we have all the current deals?

Kevin, try to determine the last day ENA supplied these deals.

Thanks.

I'm out this afternoon.  Please call me on my cell phone of you have any questions.  My number is 713-557-5095.

Thanks.

El Paso and Reliant don't have time to talk about right now but I'm also having a problem telling them about the deal because there are too many unknowns.  It's not the same as selling parked gas on Sonat.

Still working it though.

Subject: RE: Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC


Chip,

This e-mail confirms the info that we talked about this morning:

1)  We found the old interruptible transport contract that is referenced in the firm storage agreement.  It is a maximum rate transport contract that allows discounting of transport rates.  I do not know what the maximum transport rate is for Bridgeline, but it is probably one rate for the entire pipeline.  No active discounts were found in ENA's records.  With the pipeline's cooperation, however, new discounts can be negotiated.
2)  Under ENA's firm storage agreement, you must withdraw it from storage at the Storage Delivery/Redelivery Point which is defined as the interconnect between the storage field and Bridgeline Pipeline System.  This means that some sort of transportation agreement on Bridgeline must be used if ENA does not sell the inventory in place.
3)  Chris is making some preliminary calls to gauge the market interest for purchasing ENA's storage inventory.  So far he has not received much positive feedback.  As we discussed before, using an interruptible transport contract puts the shipper at risk that the gas will show up everyday and be available for sale to third parties.  The price ENA receives from purchasers will most likely be discounted for this IT transport risk.

Good luck with the meeting,
Ruth

I've made a few changes.  I've heard from Greg and OpCo is on-board.

One remaining question is whether we go in offering to pay demand charges for the total 2.5Bcf or only the 1.9+Bcf actually used during this period, given that the gas was trapped.  The ratable amount is approximately $100k lower than the $575k in the letter.  If for no other reason, from a negotiating perspective I believe we should go in with the lower number.  Mark, do you have a view on this?  If our legal analysis is clearly based on demand charges at the maximum volume, we probably should stay with the $575k.

Shemin, I'm sending this to you company email and your Enron email.  Do you use the Enron email system?

Wade said he just received a call from Gary Novenski? at DRI.  Gary was asking Wade if he had any new information.

I'm waiting for Steve Stonestreet to call me back so I can learn how to run all of these reports.

Wade is making copies of the reports he has to give to Ruth.

Susan,

I got your email address from Scott Goodell.  I hope things are going well for you and I don't know if you are working or staying at home so this may be a non event.

CMS Energy is trying to develop a presence in the North East.  A headhunter set me up with an interview at CMS last Friday.  I spoke with Curt Lizzi, Vice President of Wholesale Gas Trading.  I don't know why he agreed to see me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was looking for.  He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience.  He said he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year.  You just never know.  His number is 713-230-7205.

Let me know how things are going.  ME??  just focused on living in sin with a pregnant girlfriend.

Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.

Questions that need to be answered, 
	** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?

	

The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.  In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

Hi Chris,
I am just checking to see whether you sent me your conclusions regarding
whether ENA should terminate the pooling agreement with Dominion. Do we
still need to speak with Iris? And, can we set up a meeting with Ed
McMichael so that we can make a decision and move forward? Please call
(5-3910) or email me.
Thanks,
Shemin

   that was official notification that you weren't employed any longer. Do

Leon Payne, Ingrid's boss at Transco is resigning for personal reasons.  That kind of came as a surprise to everyone over there.  They supposedly have a reorg thing going on over there too.  Don't know if that's it or not.   The lease at the tower is up ?next year? I think.  The new CEO said staying in the tower is their first choice but they want to lease 20 floors instead of 40.  If that doesn't work, then they may move West to Beltway 8 somewhere.

Recommendation for ENA Pools
1st choice  Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition.
2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow
3rd choice  Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.

I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck.  Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone.  When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel.  I have not done that.  I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  

Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following.
	1.  Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket.
	2.  ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition.
	3.  The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.

Items to consider
If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers.  Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated.  I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances.  The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process.  Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.

Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance.  On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.

Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity.  I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.

Our current cash balance with Reliant is $52,850.00.  We did not request any gas for tomorrow under the swing arrangements.  I have requested a wire in the amount of $22,000.00 to be made on Friday April 12th.

Melissa, I had to move the payment to Friday because some Enron "approval" people are out of the office but we have a large cash balance and it shouldn't be a problem if it gets delayed untill Monday.

Also, Tiffanie Wheeler discovered an error in my worksheet that impacted the cash balance effective March 1st forward.  My worksheet is set up so that any change in a volume or price for a prior month will change the current cash balance.  I will keep track of all changes at the bottom of the Summary worksheet in this file.

i took the test and this is what it said.
colors green blue yello purple red black white orange
You are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard.
You are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'. In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'. It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure.
Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being.
You are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'.
You need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them.
Don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy.  Just remember, no woman deserves you and they should all thank their lucky stars that you even ackknowledge them.

Nicole, I have the Boston Gas confirmation letter.  Thanks.

Kimat, are you familiar with the Boston Gas worksheet Dick Jenkins would update to calculate the Tenn Z6 city gate price?  It wasn't very big, and Dick would have me verify the Iroquois and Tenn transport variable cost.

I thought we only had cashout, at most 3 times, before this June.  I can't remember.  I do know that most of the time this plant was not buring like it did in July and August of this year.  I say we just keep the dough and go to Mexico.

Hey guys,

Would you please ck the Oglethorpe deal from July 2000  - Dec 2000? Is there supposed to be a cashout booked in Sitara for these months?  Oglethorpe over paid their invoice every month.  I believe that Doug told me the extra was for the cashout that was not invoiced.

Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
You're a pain in the ass,
But I s'pose I am, too.

So oft when we meet,
We fuss and we fight.
It becomes hard to see
That we share a love of great might.

But no matter the tears,
Or gut wrenching fears.
As we grow old,
We create a togetherness,
Lovely to behold.

Please read the note below from Jeff at Lone Star, it looks like we may need to be particular for May.  Of cause that would involve me knowing a little more about the pipeline.

The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M.  Also you need to know
that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant.  This means that
what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
you burn.  Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
during this time period.

I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.

I, of course MUST have my lunch hour.  But after that is over, say 1:00 or so, lets get together.  Shemin, you set the time.  Wade, bring some of those letters you are talking about down below.

Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.  Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd?? and terminate the pools without Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.  You and Patricia can decide if you want to come.

I am in receipt of several faxes from Dominion Transmission Inc which inform Enron of DTI's intention of not crediting gas from listed meters/producers to Enron's pool.  Per Dan Baney of DTI, the listed effective dates are dates as of which gas will not be credited.  In some cases, they are taking back gas previously allocated to the pool. 

While DTI is asking for a signoff from Enron agreeing to these statements, we have not sent any back.  I have forwarded all of these to you for handling along with the many other issues between Enron, DTI, and the affected producers.

Dominion's lawyer left me a message that they are sticking with the termination.  I will send them a letter telling them that we will be covering.

Mark Ellenberg is off for Passover.  We can discuss options early next week.  I have beed in contact with him, and he is familiar with the issues.

The contract is a bit complicated.  I will prepare a contract summary along the lines of what Pete prepared for MCV.

Reliant has indicated that we must use their paper - this point is non-negotiable.

Kay, we will not wire any funds to Reliant until we have your approval of the contract.  I understand that you are also working on a gas contract with TXU.  We need one of these contracts in place so we can buy gas tomorrow morning, it doesn't matter which contract we have in place first.

Doug, Phil, Eric,
The prepayment that we were going to send to Reliant may be going to TXU instead.  We are coming dangerously close to defaulting on the Tallahassee contract.  Robin and I are going to work on a prepayment request for TXU after lunch.

If that is the case then converting 327,081gj's to mm's yields 310,012mm's, so you are probably correct, I can adjust it to reduce down the 12mm's.

I am starting to path it up right now, I have a question regarding the volume. The way I have interpreted these e-mails, we should be withdrawing a total of 310,000 from dawn storage, right now deal1199439 is set up to deliver 327,081. I can adjust the back end days to reduce our deliveries down to 310,000, just want to be sure this is our target #.

There is nothing in Deal Volume Tracking regarding this deal.  I checked with Rita Wynne and she says it needs to be pathed.  As soon as that is done and I am notified, we can get the invoice out to MidAmerican.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 
Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 
        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.
Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 
 
Any comments or questions?

Interesting because this capacity was released non-recallable to CES which was assigned (not via capacity release) to ENA.  

FYI, 

	demand charge =  $2.6614 per month    = $.0875 per dth 
	and the commodity is			$.0136
	Fuel =  2.902 % and at $2.10 = 		$.0628

	100% load factor cost = 			$.1639

As far as I know, ENA is not using any transport on Columbia Gas or Gulf.  If NiSource wants to recall, I do not believe it will create a problem.
Kim Olinger is coordinating all the Logistics activities for the wholesale desk.   (Kim...would you please confirm....).

It's important to note, that if ENA wants to keep this capacity, they must pay in full the outstanding indebtedness, together with accrued interest at the Commission approved interest rate, and furnish adequate assurance of payment to Releasor if required by the Releasor w/n 24 hours of being notified.
Since this message was not received from Nisource until 3:08 p.m. 1/31/02........ officially, Nisource can not recall the capacity until the evening cycle of 2/1/02.

I do want you to know that EES is actively nominating on Columbia Gas Transmission to the Columbia Gas of Ohio and PA markets.  If we receive any notice
of capacity recall on EES capacity, we will want to react and it will be critical to communicate this notification to me ASAP.

Thanks Rita!!

Donna,

I mentioned this to Bob on yesterday and he said to forward this to you.  We have not made any payments since we filed bankruptcy for pre or post petition activity at the direction of management.  When I spoke with the guy on yesterday, we agreed exactly on one of the invoices for around $80K, but he was supposed to get me the other contract number and amount since there are supposedly two outstanding invoices.  Please let me know how we need to handle this.

Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. has an existing capacity release to Enron North
America for 30,000 Dth per day. This release of Columbia Gulf FTS-1
capacity has a term expiring on March 31, 2002.

It is our understanding that Enron has not paid Columbia Gulf the November
2001 payment or the December 2001 payment. Since Enron has defaulted on its
post petition payment and Columbia Gas of Ohio is ultimately responsible
for payment to Columbia Gulf, pursuant to the Columbia Gulf tariff,
Columbia Gas of Ohio has the right to recall the capacity upon 24 hours
notice.

Columbia Gas of Ohio hereby gives notice to Enron that unless payment is
made to Columbia Gulf by 5:00 pm on Friday, February 1, 2002 by wire
transfer, Columbia Gas of Ohio will recall the capacity effective Tuesday,
February 5, 2002.

If you would like to discuss this matter, please give me a call at
telephone number 614-460-4996.

I spoke again this morning to Pamela Brumbaugh at Texas Gas Transmission about contract #T018176.       This contract was acquired by capacity release from SIGCORP ENERGY.    Since ENA failed to pay the bill for November 2001 production,   then TGT's tariff allows them to go back to the original contract party -- SIGCORP ENERGY to get payment.    So TGT reversed the demand charges on our invoice and in turn sent an invoice to SIGCORP for this November 2001 production demand payment.    Thus it would appear that eventually ENA would have to make payment to SIGCORP Energy,   but as this winds thru the bankruptcy proceedings,  this issue will need to get clarified.

Chris Spears -- please put a copy of this email in your TGT files.

Drew,
We MAY need to make a payment for June gas of appx. $1.3MM for City of Tallahassee, which is on the gas cash forecast.  However, I am not certain that we will be buying the gas.  That decision will be made tomorrow, so please stay ready and we will inform you once we decide.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Ed,

Should I be expecting/receiving a request to prepay June gas?  My records show that our last prepay for gas occurred on April 29th.  Do you have any feel for how much/when we plan to pay?

Thanks,

Hey there.  I did get your message and yes we did wire $26,000.00 yesterday that is for a gas prepayment.  Pete sent me an email earlier this week asking for a confirmation number from our treasury department of the wires we make.  I like that idea and I'm still working on getting the info to add to my worksheet.

thanks.

Columbia Gas sent me the December invoices via federal express.  The cover letter states that Columbia Gas is aware that ENA will not be paying the pre-petition amounts but that they expect full payment for the post-petition amounts.

I'm sending you a copy of the letter.  I assume that we will not be paying any of the invoice.

Any news on the Columbia Gas park & loans?

Thanks

Elizabeth Hernandez is currently working as a contract employee for Sherry Thomas.  Elizabeth told me her contract runs out at the end of this month.  Kathy and I both loved working with her and think she would be a good employee to keep on the gas side if you have any spots available.  Her last spot on the gas side was in deal validation.

	Margaret,

	I have bought the gas from Mario Silva at Anadarko.  His number is 832-636-7164.  Listed below are the volumes and prices.

	Trunkline ELA	12,800 MMbtu@$2.28		$904,704
	PEPL		  5,000 MMbtuf@$2.25		  348,750
	ANR SE	  4,000 MMbtu@$2.28		  282,720
	
	Total 						$1,536,174

	I verbally confirmed the wiring information with Mario.  The wire needs to go out on Feb. 27.  I have requested that Mario email me 
	all the pertinent information just to doublecheck.  I will forward you the email when I receive it.  I will do the cash request next.

	Thanks
	Robin

I was in the process of setting this up, but I got side tracked!  I was going to be administrator - but please feel free to do it yourself,
you know more about it than me!

Hi team.  I'm going to set myself up as the Navigator administrator for Enron North America unless someone else wants to do it.  We use Navigator for activity on Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf, Crossroads, and KO Transmission.  I think we also use Navigator to download the invoices.

I'm going to kill all the ID's shown below except mine.  Should I set up anyone else with an ID?

Hey Chris:

Are there any other Enron companies that you need to look at as far as
Navigator ID's?  If so I can forward that info to you.

Below are two attachments; one for the new admin (you) and one to remove
exiting Nav ids or to add new Nav ids'.

(See attached file: ADD_CHANGE_ADMINISTRATOR_FORM.doc)            (See
attached file: ADD_REMOVE_USER_FORM.doc)


Since Robert Allwein is the current, can you get his signature on the
Change Adm form?  If you can GREAT!.....if not then the form must be
signed by a Notary.  Then you can go ahead and sign the forms to remove any
ids.

You can call me at  1 800 628 4867.  I really appreciate your help in
getting this account cleaned up.

Thanks,

Tallahassee called on the gas for the weekend.  I had planned for that in my numbers but I had no idea prices would go up $.07 - $.11 for the weekend - my fault.  This makes my cash balance at Reliant short by about $130.00 if prices post on the high side.  My trading contact at Reliant said that his credit department DOES NOT want to work with us at all.  My contact said his credit department could force him to cut the deal.  We won't know until this afternoon or Monday.  So please try to get the wire out today.

Thanks

fyi,

you guys can really help your child in the future by giving her lots of sensory input.  by sensory input i mean:  swaddling, stroking down her arms, legs and back  with different textures.  (diffferent types of fabric, ie, satin, terry cloth, knit etc....)  there is also a sensory brush but i don't know about it's use on babies.

the reason i say this is that my  children both have a sensory deficiency.  my little one, jerald, goes to occupational therapy once  a week for sensory input.  which is really nothing more than alot of fun play activities that incorporate the senses.  

in the information i was given to read for jerald,  they mentioned a link between c-section babies and sensory deficiits.  they claim that alot of sensory input occurs when the baby is pushed through and out of the birth canal which c-section babies obviously miss.  i don't know how true this is but the sensory input can't hurt her.

Thanks.  I appreciate that.  It is a bit gloomy and MOODY over here.  I don't think too many people are excited about Dynegy but its better than bankruptcy.

And I do appreciate the job offer, its just hard to do with a family.  But I will chat with my significant other and see what she says.  I've asked her about moving before and I thought she was going to hit me.

Hey Chris,

I hope the madness that's been occurring over there isn't weighing you down
too much.

I just wanted you to know my offer stands if you'd be interested in looking
at moving to LA to manage our T&E.  Our asset base has been growing and we
are looking to expand some more. Your expertise would be tremendous.  Let me
know.

I am requesting the following prepays to Reliant and Dominion for tomorrow.  All of these request are signed and on Doug's desk.

Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00

Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract
		10,000 dth x 2 days x $3.50 per dth = $70,000.00

Prepay to Dominion Oklahoma for April baseload activity 10,000 dth x 30 days x $2.1562 per dth = $646,860.00

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

In September, ENA agreed to purchase capacity from New Power on Transco.  The total demand charge should have been $9,000.00 on contract 4.0159.  New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it.  The actual demand charge billed was $270,000.00.  New Power agreed to reimburse ENA for the difference of $261,000.00.

ENA will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $270,000.00 and bill New Power $261,000.00 on deal 1110019.

Theresa Vos tells me that she receives invoices directly from the suppliers and also receives an estimate of where the invoices should be from Justin Fernandez.  She says the two have reconciled closely since she's been responsible for payment (she picked this up in the Jan-Feb timeframe), with actuals usually coming in below Justin's estimates.  Accordingly, she has paid the invoiced amounts directly to the supplier without further reconcilliation.

Based on the above, should I be concerned with the "settlements" process?

Would you mind reviewing the P&L reports with Sabra.  Kim used to check there reports after flash, and Sabra will begin taking over those responsibilities.

Appreciate your help!

I can't find any of the reports that Kim Olinger used to run out of Unify.  BUT, Jeanne Wukasch was in Kim's group and she would know how to run them.  I believe they were called Service P&L reports.  The only thing we would use them for now are transport demand charges.

From: 	Office of the Chief Executive  
Sent:	Friday, March 29, 2002 11:19 AM
To:	DL-GA-all_Enron_Domestic
Subject:	Retention & Severance Plan


To:  All US Domestic Employees
From:  Office of the Chief Executive

Earlier this week, we reached final resolution with the Creditors' Committee on a comprehensive retention and severance plan for employees of debtor companies, or those parts of Enron in bankruptcy.  Later this morning, we will file the plan with the bankruptcy court.  It will be public and posted on the court's website, but we have posted the plan on <http://home.enron.com>.  (See link below).  Other creditors and interested parties are allowed to review and comment on the plan.  After that, the court may approve or modify it.  We have asked the court to expedite a hearing date to consider the plan and we anticipate a hearing will be scheduled as early as the middle of April.

We want you to know that this plan is the result of much negotiation and compromise between Enron and our Creditors' Committee.  To be viable for approval by the bankruptcy court, a plan has to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors.  This plan meets that criterion.

We know all of you are interested in the plan's details so you can have some degree of financial certainty and make educated decisions for your future.  To help you fully understand how the retention and severance plan will work, we should first explain some near-term restructuring goals.

As we work to secure the most value for our creditors and other stakeholders, restructuring requires us to determine which assets or businesses provide greater value by being sold, as well as which assets or businesses provide greater value by generating ongoing cash flows.  We do have businesses and assets that are capable of emerging from bankruptcy.  We intend to separate those businesses from the liabilities and litigation facing the estate so they can succeed as part of a viable reorganized entity.

This will require us to identify employees best suited to liquidate non-core assets or wind down the estate, as well as employees best suited to support an emerging business.  Given the inherent uncertainty of restructuring, the retention and severance plan offers some measure of financial assurance to all employees of debtor companies regardless of their role within the organization.

The proposed plan is retroactive to March 1, 2002, and has a maximum value up to $130 million depending on the value of asset sales and other cash collections.  It includes the following components:
Severance benefits valued up to $7 million,
Retention payments valued at $40 million, and
Liquidation incentive pool, which is a variable pool tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate, with a minimum value of $7.4 million and a maximum value of up to $90 million, one percent of the estate's cash collection target of $9 billion.

SEVERANCE BENEFITS
A primary component of the proposed retention and severance plan is a new severance program for employees of debtor companies not currently participating in another plan.  Under the proposed plan, employees will be eligible for two weeks base pay for every full or partial year of service, with a maximum of eight weeks base pay and a minimum of $4,500.  If an employee resigns voluntarily or is terminated for cause, he or she is not eligible for severance benefits.

Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute separate severance plans for their employees.  This was possible because their plans do not require the approval of the bankruptcy court.  The details of those plans have been shared with employees of non-debtor companies.

RETENTION
Under the proposed plan, retention payments will be made to many employees in debtor companies whose skills or knowledge are required indefinitely, or for a predetermined duration of the restructuring.  Regrettably, not all employees will receive retention.

An eligible employee's retention will be a percentage of his or her quarterly base salary.  At the beginning of each quarter, or three-month period, eligible employees will be informed of their projected range of retention compensation for the period by their supervisors.  The actual quarterly payout an employee earns will be decided at the end of the quarter based on performance and achievements during the period.

An employee participating in the retention program will receive 25 percent of the earned quarterly retention at the end of each period, with payouts as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 75 percent of the earned retention for a period is non-vested, deferred, and will be paid to an employee after February 28, 2003.

If involuntarily terminated without cause prior to February 28, 2003, an employee will receive all deferred retention, plus retention based on the actual earned salary for the quarter in which he or she is terminated.  Employees' earned and deferred retention payments are considered post-petition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate.

An employee involuntarily terminated without cause is eligible for the greater of severance benefits or earned retention, with the total amount of retention payments received offsetting the amount of severance received.  Depending on an employee's personal circumstances, a participant in the retention program may wish to consider setting aside some portion of retention as a financial safety net in the event he or she is involuntarily terminated.

If an employee receiving retention voluntarily resigns prior to February 28, 2003, or is terminated for cause, he or she does not earn a retention payment for that quarter and forfeits all deferred retention.  He or she would not be eligible for severance.

Any amounts not paid out are returned to the retention fund and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program.

LIQUIDATION INCENTIVE POOL
Under the proposed plan, employees identified as critical to the sale of non-core assets and businesses will be eligible to participate in the liquidation incentive pool (LIP).  The amount of money in the pool will be directly tied to the amount of cash collected by the estate.

Enron's management committee will have discretion to assign incentive payments to participants in the liquidation pool after each $500 million dollars is collected, also called a "collection milestone".  Fifty percent of an employee's earned liquidation incentive for a collection period will be distributed at the time a milestone is reached.  The remaining 50 percent of the earned liquidation incentive is non-vested and deferred.

If a collection milestone is not reached in a given quarter, but progress has been made, a quarterly advance may be allocated among participants of the program based on a quarterly floor amount of $1.85 million.  Fifty percent of an employee's quarterly advance will be paid as soon as practical after May 31, August 31, November 30, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  The remaining 50 percent of an earned advance will be non-vested and deferred, and will offset against future incentive payments.

All accrued and deferred liquidation will be paid at the earlier of the following events:
1.		Enron's reorganization is complete; or
2.	the employee is involuntarily terminated without cause, or
3.	upon specified dates related to incremental cash collections.

Employees' earned and deferred liquidation incentives are considered post-petition administrative claims that take precedent over other obligations owed by the estate.

Employees participating in the liquidation incentive pool are not eligible for severance benefits.  If an employee receiving liquidation incentives voluntarily resigns prior to February 28, 2003, or is terminated for cause, he or she will forfeit any deferred liquidation incentive payment and any minimum liquidation payment for the quarter in which he or she resigns.

Any amounts not paid out are returned to the liquidation incentive pool and could be reallocated to current or new participants of the program.

OTHER ITEMS
Bankruptcy law allows creditors to claim as fraudulent any significant payments made by a company in the 90-day period prior to its bankruptcy's filing.  To that end, creditors may attempt to reclaim retention payments made prior to Enron's bankruptcy filing that they perceive were inappropriate or have not returned adequate value to the estate.  The Creditors' Committee has agreed to forego its right to pursue claims against any current employee who agrees to release claims against the company, and stays with the company through August 31, 2002, or until he or she is involuntarily terminated without cause, whichever comes first.

All debtor company employees will be required to sign a general release to receive their final severance benefits, deferred quarterly retention payments, or deferred liquidation payments.

We know how long you have waited for details about this plan.  We will instruct supervisors to begin communicating projected participation to each individual employee next week.  Although the Creditors' Committee has approved it, this proposed plan is not final until approved by the bankruptcy court.  Therefore, it is possible an employee's status could change depending on the final plan approved by the court.  Supervisors will hold follow up meetings with each employee to confirm his or her individual participation after the bankruptcy court rules on the plan.

Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

Chris,
I work with Richard in the Chicago office.  I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston.  Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC.  The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled?  With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.

No I am not.  Donna Grief called me on Monday concerning this and I told her we would need Commercial's blessing and then approval by the cash committee.  I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.  I'm not really sure what group should handle it.  Is there an invoice that you can get to me so that I can have it as backup support for the cash request?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate. 
I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?

I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.  Is Joe Parks leaving or something, why are you doing all this stuff now?

FYI:  I call it the Cleburne Plant and it is at the same point as it was for the first 3 days of the month.  The scheduler over there calls me every morning to verify.

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

Looks like you are right about CNR Mar-02. You can fix them on the tab labeled CNRVol (or call me and I'll come do it real quick).

Processing charges are billed by CGAS and CNR (and Gatherco too).  They would be processed and paid by Volume Management.  Some of the extra $0.03 charges are billed by Mark West.

I'm working on the volume split files for Dec-01 Dominion. We can match it with the status/effective date file Robin is fixing.

Call you soon.

Why doesn't Enron promote from within.... same old story. It just took a
long time before EOL had the markets out there.

I leave Tuesday evening. There is a dinner Monday night... you should get
an
invite... since Goodell has to do the family thing... as always.

What happen to Dick??

Scott is your main man - I guess.  I don't know if he is going to keep
doing it or if he's going to hire an analyst.  I think Susan will be doing
Texas Eastern.  Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on
Tuesday.  I may be going Tues afternoon.

When do you leave Houston?

Vickey told me yesterday was her last day. I see Scott Neal is on Tenn Z0.

There are no quotes out there... just for Enron's info.

I'll be in town this weekend.. going to TCO/Gulf meeting Monday and
Tuesday.
Hope to see you.

Hope your back and other aches are okay.

Gloria is out sick but she's checking her voicemails.  I'm meeting with Wade at his desk at 1:30 today and Gloria is going to call us.  We should be able to figure out how the contracts work then Wade and I can meet with you this afternoon when you become available.

I'm still waiting to hear from EES - no word at all.

Wait just a minute.  Don't Goodell and I get a wedding invite?  Maybe we want to give you an expensive gift!  YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!   We are poorer than college students now.  I think you should send us an invite anyway.  Maybe I could make a bachelor party out of it.  At least I could get drunk.  So do you have all that wedding crap stuff done or is your MAN taking care of all that?  I always heard that it was WOMAN's work anyway.  

Those are fantastic grades.  You would have to ADD my old college grades together to get a 3.83, and I still think it would be a struggle.  I know you told me but I can't remember, whets is your major?  MBA?

Its good to hear about Alicia.  Is she going to grad school?

I don't know when me and my very pregnant girlfriend are getting married.  We move in together at the end of Feb.  I'm nervous about that.  I've been living alone since '97 and I just don't know why all you foolish people want to get married and live together.  I took some digital photo's of her yesterday.  I'll let you know if I get them on the web so you can take a look and make fun of me being a 40 year old father to be.

As far as I am concerned, yes I am still in love. Our wedding is on March 23 on Clearwater Beach, FL. It should be pretty cool. School is awesome. I got a 3.83 last term. Hopefully I'll be able to pull off a 4.0 this time. I saw Alicia Perkins over Christmas. I drove over to Daytona Beach, FL to hang out with her. She is doing very well. She's working for her Dad's real estate company. Anyhow, I'll talk to you later. Take care.

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

While it has been discouraging to see an endless stream of negative news coverage about Enron, we want you to know about some positive news that is starting to emerge.  ABC News was at Enron today because they want to do a story about Enron's future, our business going forward and the tremendous work being performed by the remaining 20,000 employees worldwide.  The segment is scheduled to appear on both Good Morning America and on ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on Wednesday, Feb. 20.  The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. CST.   Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight.  While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron, the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging.  We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air.  

Additionally, two articles featuring interviews with Interim CEO Steve Cooper ran yesterday in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.  We are forwarding them to you for your information.  Thank you for your support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees.


MONEY
New Enron CEO turns company focus to future ; While workers cope with loss and uncertainty
Noelle Knox

USA Today
FINAL
B.03
(Copyright 2002)

HOUSTON -- Inside Enron headquarters, employees walk by stacks of moving boxes as they scrounge for pens and Post-it Notes from the empty desks of their laid-off co-workers. On one desk, an employee finds a note that reads: "I'm not gone, don't take my stuff!" 
Forgotten behind the headlines of smoking guns, Aspen ski homes and shredded documents are almost 18,000 employees who work on Enron's power plants and pipelines.
USA TODAY is the first to get a tour inside Enron since its collapse late last year and spend time with Stephen Cooper, the new chief executive, talking about his vision for the future. 
On the 50th floor of executive suites, decorated with rich carpets and velvet-covered chairs, there is a sweeping view of Houston -- a city Enron helped shape with its philanthropy, political donations and corporate muscle. Cooper, however, is only focused on saving part of the company. 
His plan faces monumental challenges. In his words, "Everybody's betting against us." 
While many American corporate icons have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the past year -- Kmart, Polaroid, Bethlehem Steel -- the size, speed and sordid details of Enron's collapse have sparked numerous investigations and lawsuits, angered creditors, demoralized employees and ruined its reputation. 
But Cooper -- whose firm Zolfo Cooper worked on the troubles of such companies as Polaroid, Sunbeam and Federated Department Stores - - is adamant Enron can emerge healthy from bankruptcy within a year. 
"I've probably been in more Chapter 11s than anybody in the United States, literally," he says. "This company, by way of business and asset base, by way of management team, by way of predictability of its future business, has more of all of that than most distressed businesses I've ever seen." 
Cooper's plans 
The company already has sold the energy-trading business that was once considered its crown jewel to UBS Warburg. Although a bankruptcy court and Enron's creditors must first approve any moves, Cooper's plans include: 
* Enron will likely have to give up this skyscraper for a "more modest habitat," Cooper says. 
* The company's new $100 million building across the street from headquarters also is for sale. 
* Even Enron's name blazoned across the top of the nearby Major League Baseball stadium is going to have to go. 
"Out of the ashes, there ought to be something everyone can be proud of a year, or two, or three from now," he says. 
Today, the company still has a pipeline network that stretches from Canada to California and from Texas to Florida. And Cooper is betting that business can power the light at the end of the tunnel. 
He wants to keep the North American and South American pipelines and power plants and sell or shut down the rest of the company's businesses, including its broadband network, water utilities and the like. 
That will mean cutting an additional 10% to 20% off Enron's payroll and returning the company to its natural gas pipeline roots of the 1980s. 
But to pull off his plan, Cooper must not only sway his critics, including giant Wall Street creditors, but also motivate thousands of devastated employees. 
"Cooper and (Enron President Jeff) McMahon have one of the toughest jobs in business to keep the people there and keep them motivated," says John Whitney, a turnaround expert and professor at Columbia University. 
To lock in 500 key executives, Enron offered $55 million in retention bonuses. Former Enron executives who went to UBS Warburg as part of the sale of the energy-trading business also pocketed multimillion-dollar payoffs. 
And Cooper's pay? 
The New York-based consulting firm Zolfo Cooper will receive $1.3 million a year, plus $1.2 million for each of the eight executives he brought with him to Houston. If Enron emerges from bankruptcy, Cooper's firm will get a $5 million fee. If Enron is liquidated, Cooper will get a fee agreed upon by the creditors and court, according to a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. 
Shattered morale 
Enron's fall from grace has shattered employee morale. 
"It's just so sad," says one current employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "On several floors, it looks like the rapture. It looks like people disappeared into space. They're just gone." 
This employee, just two years away from retirement, watched $160,000 in retirement savings shrink to zero with Enron's stock price. "Now I'm going to have to work as a greeter at Wal-Mart until I'm 90," the employee says. "It's gone. I just can't make it back." 
Jorge Garcia, a project controls manager laid off in December, says his friends still at Enron say, " 'You can tell if you'll be let go soon by your office accommodations. If you've been moved to a cubicle, you probably won't last long.' " 
That kind of stress takes its toll. 
Downstairs in the company gym, Kathy Kissner, a massage therapist, says that as the company fell apart, employees would call begging for any open appointment or even just five minutes between appointments. 
"I've lost 30 pounds in the last six months" from long hours and lack of sleep, says Mark Palmer, vice president of communications. 
Cooper knows his employees have been hurt financially and emotionally. It's the hardest part of his job. 
"When people are looking at the prospect of losing enormous amounts of money, they often times get heated. They get emotional and upset," he says. "It's never fun to be at the receiving end, but I've gotten used to it." 
Blast voice mail 
To motivate the employees, he is trying to focus them on future goals. "People have two choices: We can spend all of our time living in the past, which is a crazy way to spend your life. You can't change it. Or, we can begin to move beyond the disappointment and the upset and the loss, to focus on the future," he says. 
And he has opened up lines of communication. 
Once a week, he sends out a lengthy voice mail, telling employees what has happened during the past week, explaining management changes and timetables. 
When employees call or send him e-mail, he will go find them in the building to answer their questions. And next month, he will hold a meeting with all of the employees in Houston to explain the details of his strategy to bring the company out of bankruptcy. 
This kind of candid communication is essential, he says. 
"We are not trying to eliminate bad news. We are not trying to make it just good news. What we are trying to do is to eliminate uncertainty," he says. "People can live with either one of those, good or bad. What they can't live with is uncertainty." 
And while some still say Enron's future is uncertain, Cooper is certain of one thing: 
"The lives and reputations of 20,000 people shouldn't be trash- canned because a handful of geniuses decided to run wild," he says. "People ought to keep in perspective that we've got a lot of really tremendous people here, and for the sake of a couple bad apples, we shouldn't blowtorch the entire field."

The Nation Acting CEO Plans Legal Assault Amid Effort to Salvage Enron Litigation: Those who helped fell the energy giant would be targeted, Stephen Cooper says.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. is planning a broad legal assault against those who helped bring the company down, according to acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper, the corporate rescue artist who was selected three weeks ago to put the company back on the road to solvency. 
Cooper said in an interview that the litigation would be extensive and rapid, although he declined to identify specific targets.
"Enron may have causes of action against institutions and individuals that could represent a meaningful asset for the estate," said Cooper, a principal with Zolfo Cooper, a New York consulting firm that specializes in corporate restructuring. "I think you will see something sooner as opposed to later." 
The players were many in what has become a lurid corporate morality play, and all are potential defendants. 
Enron filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2, following a series of damaging disclosures of questionable transactions with partnerships controlled by company employees. The nation's seventh-largest company collapsed less than seven weeks after it disclosed losses tied to the off-the-books partnerships, wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and more than 6,000 jobs. 
An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least $1 billion in recent losses, while a few company employees reaped millions of dollars in personal profits. Directors and executives, including former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, failed to curb the missteps of subordinates, the report concluded. It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen, Enron's auditor, and Vinson & Elkins, one of its outside law firms. 
Still Sorting Out All the Issues 
Cooper, who occupies Skilling's old office on the 50th floor of Enron's mirrored office tower in downtown Houston, said the company has not asked any former employees to repay the millions of dollars they earned from partnership transactions. That would include former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, former Enron Global Finance executive Michael Kopper and former Treasurer Ben F. Glisan. 
"I think that the recovery vehicle in the main will be litigation," Cooper said. 
Cooper and his team are still "sorting out issues" related to Enron's financial statements and the value of its trading book, the contracts that were not included in the recent sale of its energy trading operation. Since Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection, the value of those contracts has eroded to about $1 billion from about $7 billion. 
"I certainly don't believe at this particular point in time that anybody is engaging in transactions that aren't completely above board," Cooper said. "We will be presenting to the creditors committee on a regular basis our financial statements, which I believe, in the main, will be accurate." Enron has not yet hired a new auditor to replace Andersen, which it fired. 
Enron already has filed a $10-billion lawsuit against Dynegy Inc. alleging that its cross-town rival withdrew from a proposed merger with Enron in late November as part of a plan to wreck the ailing company. Dynegy has said it pulled out of the merger because Enron misrepresented the depths of its financial problems and lost its investment-grade credit rating. 
The Enron that Cooper envisions will look much different from the market-dominating energy trader that Lay and Skilling built. The name will change, and the company will focus on its natural gas pipelines and power plants--the kind of hard assets Skilling said he disdained. 
Cooper's style, too, is unlike Lay's grandfatherly and professorial demeanor and Skilling's hard-driving image. Cooper insists on being called by his first name and dresses casually at the office, complete with baseball cap. He hasn't decorated Skilling's wood-paneled, deadbolted office. 
To keep up employee morale, Cooper said he visits workers in response to e-mail and sends out weekly, unscripted voicemail updates. An all-employee meeting will be held soon, he said. 
Enron's overhaul is well underway. 
Enron has agreed reluctantly to turn over to Dynegy its biggest pipeline, 16,500-mile Northern Natural Gas, which was a condition of the $1.5 billion that Dynegy invested in Enron as part of the aborted merger. Enron also recently gave away its vaunted energy-trading operation to New York investment banking firm UBS Warburg in a no-cash deal that would supply Enron with a cut of any future profit. 
What remains is an assortment of smaller natural gas pipelines, including one that runs from Texas to California, and electricity generating plants. Enron has announced plans to shut down its remaining telecommunications operations and to unload Portland General, its Oregon utility, as well as many of the international power plants and other assets whose poor performance helped sink the company. 
Cooper declined to detail which assets he is thinking of unloading because "we haven't settled on a final configuration yet. But it will be substantially smaller by way of reported revenue than the old Enron. 
"The company, if you remove the trading from the rest of the business, it's actually got a very good, very solid, very revenue- and cash-flow- and earnings-predictable business, which is really its power and pipes business," Cooper said. "So in my view, there is an eminently reorganizable entity here." 
'Not Going to Wallow and Linger' 
Cooper expects to present "a fairly on-point direction" for reorganization to its creditors committee in the second quarter and to have settled on a new version of the company within a year. 
"We're going to move this process forward very quickly. We're not going to wallow and linger in Chapter 11 for a day longer than we have to." 
Although many have speculated that Enron will never emerge from bankruptcy and will instead be carved up and sold, Cooper said he is "not of that mind," adding that in his 30-year career of reorganizing companies he has seen only a few instances in which liquidation made more sense for creditors than reorganizing the ongoing business. Those cases all involved substantial amounts of valuable real estate, he said. 
Enron has a bit of that. Although it leases its Houston headquarters, Enron is building a tower nearly as tall next door. It has received $40 million in debtor financing to complete and sell that project. 
Cooper flatly states that he is not interested in doing a post-mortem on Enron, but he did acknowledge the "very labor-intensive" process of sorting through "hundreds upon hundreds" of so-called special purpose entities, which are financial vehicles commonly used by corporations to finance projects separate from the company's balance sheet and for other legitimate purposes, such as a sale and lease-back of a building. 
Lawyers and accountants are examining the entities to determine the extent of Enron's liabilities and the economic value to Enron of each vehicle, he said. A team of about 10 Zolfo Cooper employees, an unusually large number, is being assigned to Enron, Cooper said. 
"There's a difference between were the partnerships legitimate or not versus were they accounted for properly or not. Both of these are being looked at. We'll just have to wait to see what the attorneys say as that gets sorted out," Cooper said. 
Special purpose entities "are not good or bad, they're just instruments or vehicles which provide companies with financial flexibility to better manage their business, to better manage their balance sheet to fit the needs of their business," Cooper said. 
"The Enron phenomenon was the failure to transfer economic risk [from Enron to the partnerships] and the failure to disclose and the suspension of the corporate code of ethics and conduct that allowed people to get into a position where they had divided loyalties" by working for both Enron and the partnerships, he said. 
"What we saw here was a case where they weren't constructed properly, they weren't reported properly and by allowing someone to be on both sides of the transaction, you couldn't have really an arm's-length transaction. It's kind of like having you negotiate both sides of a prenuptial agreement." 
Despite its size, the Enron reorganization is much like every other he has handled, Cooper said. Those included Federated Department Stores Inc., Polaroid Corp. and Malden Mills. 
Unique to Enron, however, is the furor surrounding the rapid and stunning collapse of the business, Cooper said. 
"It's become an enormous lightning rod for not only the upset of people directly involved in the company, but it's become a lightning rod to coalesce all of these other national interests" involving such issues as accounting and corporate governance, Cooper said. 
"I hope people will be able to relax and calm down and look at this as an opportunity for a fresh start for our external economic constituencies, a fresh start by way of an investment and a fresh start for our employees," Cooper said. 
"It's sort of like when your car breaks down and you're in the middle of nowhere and you end up hating the car. You're kicking the tires. You're kicking the bumpers. After you get over it, you realize that it's still a good car. You get the tire or whatever fixed and you just keep going."

Don't know about this but I am handling the activity for the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. (a.k.a. Cleburne Plant, a.k.a. Tenaska Power Partners) on Lone Star Pipeline.  We have a large imbalance on the transport contract that I'm slowly working off but that's about it.  

Are you guys aware of any storage?  I'm going to call Joe Parks later and see if he was working on anything related to storage other then Centana.  I also have a contact at  Lone Star that I could ask but I rather see if what we know form the inside first.

	Chris,

	I was working on a storage deal for a Lone Star pipeline when things blew up. I know that there was a 
	rather large imbalance to the tune of about 800,000 dth in EES's name. I was just following up to see
	if any actions had been taken to utilize or liquidate this asset.

Subject:	Sales to Midland Cogen

We stopped serving Midland Cogen on Sitara deals 340305 and 332163 effective 4/1/2002.  There are trigger prices on both of these deals which automatically generates an invoice whether we physically serve the deal or not (see invoice number 36538SA for April 2002 production).  For April 2002, these deals are generating a credit invoice in the amount of $390,748.50.  I would like to take the trigger volumes to 0 effective 4/1/2002 for the term of the deal to see if this reverses out the credit created in April and keeps us from sending out a credit invoice in the future.

Let me know if this is an issue?  

Thanks.

Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline  $40,000.00

Prepay to Reliant for intraday backup supply in case Dominion does not perform under the contract

HEY!!!  Not too much time to talk.  I'm wrapping a few things up before I take the longest vacation of my life.  I may not come in tomorrow.  We will be there Saturday with bells on.  My little woman will probably need to take a nap in the back bedroom if that's ok.  Send me an email at home AND here and let me know what time to show up.  Also, she wants to know if we need to bring any snack stuff.

Hey Buddy,

How are you?  Are you guys coming down Saturday?  Just checking.  We are
going to play the Christmas Game!  No silly, not spin the bottle, although,
there may be a few bottles spent.  The you buy a gift under $20 and try to
maintain possession of it for three turns.  We are just having snack type
food.  Let me know so I can tell my WIFE!!!

I have been working with a couple of other people trying to capture a new
recycle scrap metal contract.  We wrapped that baby up yesterday.  It has
been negotiations in earnest for the past four months.  The first real
contract negotiation I have been involved in.  The market is really tough
right now.  I am hoping for at max a third quarter rebound.  I heard some
analyst predictions which stated the global economy/demand may remain flat
for the next eight years.  I surely hope they are incorrect.

How's things in the Big City?  How's the job?  Let me know if you are coming
Saturday.

Yo' Bro'

Don

Hey team.  I think I have everyone but feel free to forward this message on to others that may need it.  Brenda Fletcher was asking me 

Enron has the following deals with AEC at Niagara and Leidy.

Deal #		Vol	Buy/Sale	Location	End Term	Book
592845		9189	Buy		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England
223854		9189	Sale		Tenn Niagara	10/31/2008	New England

415547		9000	Buy		Nful Niagara	10/31/2002	East TP1
415547		6000	Buy		Nful Leidy	10/31/2002	East TP1
1131708	6000	Sale		Nful Leidy	10/31/2008	East TP1

When this deal was done 2 years ago, AEC agreed to give Enron the NFUL transport (I don't know who at Enron agreed to this).  Enron pays NFUL max demand for the space.  I believe the contract price on deal 415547 is a NFUL Leidy price, and part of it should be adjusted for demand, commodity, and fuel.  Also the net delivered volume at Leidy is 9005 dth ( = 9189 at Niagara).


Kam, I'm not sure which firm book this is in.  Over the last few months, I would calculate the transfer price from the firm book to TP1 (or TP3).  As TP1, I take any NFUL length at a CNG equivalent price.  I also created deal 1147662 at 0 price to balance out Niagara.

Also, I believe we need to bill AEC for the demand charges for the last 2 years of this deal.  That's around $1,340,000.  I'm sure AEC is not expecting that.  Does anyone here talk to AEC?

Stacey,

I am forwarding this to you from Chris Germany to handle. I checked the deal in Sitara and the contract that is attached is contract no. 96017703. It looks like there is paper however I am having problems with Live Link. You might need to check with Ellen for the confirmation.

Chris has asked a copy of the contract or confirmation on this deal. If we have both I would probably furnish him with both.

Thanks,
Linda S. Bryan

Because you have a discount before and after makes little difference - some
people call some days and not the next.  Kathy has called on Saturday and
Sunday for intraday rates.

I will go back and make corrections for you on the 14th.  How much volume?

I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my
system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it
AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days
after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have
forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry
about it.

   Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes
   on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we
   would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in my

This is my Reliant Energy schedule.  I send this to all the people you see below at least twice a week.  I'm only doing business with them at one point and they are making money off Enron.  But he has agreed to give me a little operational flexibility over the weekends if I need it.  I send them a wire every Thursday, unless its like this week where prices ran up and I had to send it on Wednesday.

Scott, 

In reconciling imbalances with Somerset Gas Transmission Company, LLC, Volume Management has discovered two contracts that were assigned from CES.  If these are valid, we need to load beginning balances as of 12/31/99.

The contracts are as follows: 

Contract 
Number          Agent for               Type of Service Class           Rate Schedule   Beginning Balance 

3005            Dannic Energy Corp      Gathering       Interruptible   I               5,425 mmbtu 

3028            Thomas Leeper           Gathering       Interruptible   I               500 mmbtu 

I will also need a transport capacity ticket set up.  Please let me know if we should set these contracts up of not. 

Thanks, 

Sherry Anastas

Computer Gender

An English teacher was explaining to the students
the
concept of gender
association in the English language; noting how
hurricanes at one time were
given only female names, and how ships and planes
were
usually referred to
as "she." One of the students raised her hand and
asked,
"What gender is a
computer?"

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class
into two
groups:  males
in one, females in the other, and asked them to
decide if
a computer should
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked
to give
four reasons for
their recommendations.

    The group of women concluded that computers
should be
referred to as
masculine because:

1. In order to get their attention, you have to
turn them
on.

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.

3. They are supposed to help you solve your
problems, but
half the time,
they ARE the problem.

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that,
if you
had waited a
little longer, you could have had a better model.

    The men, on the other hand, decided that
computers
should definitely be
referred to as feminine because:

1. No one but their creator understands their
internal
logic.

2. The native language they use to communicate
with other
computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else.

3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in
long-term
memory for later
retrieval.

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you
find
yourself spending half
your paycheck on accessories for it.

OK, I never get to talk to Ruth because SHE IS ALWAYS ON THE PHONE.  And I bet she's on the phone with Shemin too!!!

Should we all get together and make a conference call to Dominion like we did before or should I just call Jeff Davis myself?  Our last call was Iris Kind, Bill Savier(sp?), and Jeff Davis.

Hey there...

Can you please verify the following. Our files indicate that the two pal contracts for TCO are 39607 and 38079.
TCO is invoicing us on contracts 67401 and 70457. All these contracts show 310,000 MDQ.

Which ones are correct and current. I am assuming only 2 are or should be current. Please advise.

Thanks,
Maria

I did a buy/sale with EES where EES will give me TCO pool gas and I will give EES TCO pool or CGLF Leach gas.  The volume is 14,288 per day.

The purchase deal is 1068442, at CGAS IF.  This deal will not change.

The sale deal is #1068455, at CGAS IF - .05.  I have 2 meters on this deal, Kimat, let me know if that will be a problem booking the deal in tagg.

Robert, please chat with Rhonda on which contract to use.  We need to use the same Gulf contract all month long.  It would probably be easier for Rhonda if we use the same contract we used this month.

It's not her fault.  First, everything she does or knows is officially my business.  Second, I tortured her to get information.  Third, she's a great ol' big heifer (<==female cow often used to produce many offspring) and she really needs to go.

Are there any other Enron companies that you need to look at as far as
Navigator ID's?  If so I can forward that info to you.

Below are two attachments; one for the new admin (you) and one to remove
exiting Nav ids or to add new Nav ids'.

(See attached file: ADD_CHANGE_ADMINISTRATOR_FORM.doc)            (See
attached file: ADD_REMOVE_USER_FORM.doc)


Since Robert Allwein is the current, can you get his signature on the
Change Adm form?  If you can GREAT!.....if not then the form must be
signed by a Notary.  Then you can go ahead and sign the forms to remove any
ids.

You can call me at  1 800 628 4867.  I really appreciate your help in
getting this account cleaned up.

Thanks,

Vickie

You may or may not be able to do anything about this but I've requested access to several different desk in Sitara and the people that approve these items all work for UBS.  Now I'm trying to pull up a deal that was on the central desk ( I thought) and its showing up as a west desk ticket and I can't access it.  I thought I was the one that entered it in Sitara.  Sitara deal #1198936 is an example.

Can you help get me access?

You don't need UBS approval for access to estate files.

Did you submit a request for access.  I will approve.

You can not have access to AEP info however.

I hope I have the right Bob Hall.  I'm trying to get sitara access to the West and Texas Desk and they have not been approved yet.  I'm waiting for Phillip Love (now with UBS) to approve the West and O'Neal Winfree (not sure who this is) to approve the Texas Desk.

Tommy Yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed.

I also left a message for the help desk about this.

Hi, Scott!

Thanks for thinking of me.  Lia already called me and I contacted the guy at
Shell.  They're looking for someone to do refined products marketing and
transportation.  I'm not experienced in that and frankly not very interested
in starting something completely new in the energy business.  I'm too old!!

Hope things are going well at UBS.  Say hi to everyone for me.  I sent Andy
an email several weeks ago but haven't heard back.  I know you guys are busy
trying to get everything set up.  Good luck!

Take care,

Susan,
Lia Halstead called me to say Rafeal.pina@shell.com is looking for traders.
She didn't know his number and my contact at Coral didn't find him in their
database.
My contact said it might be Equiva even with a shell address.
Not much of a lead, but hope it can help.

Subject: Termination / Release letters for Producers on Dominion Transmission



Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter. 

Several  gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool.  They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers.  Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them.  I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests.  Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships.  Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below.  I am sure more producers will call. 

Thanks  WRP 

The following producers have been calling requested such letters:

Ernie, this is what I think.  ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO citygate.  I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did with Peoples and East Ohio.  Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.

Comments, questions?

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
	Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

I've requested a prepayment for Wed in the amount of $42,000.00 due the
rise in cash prices.  I've also added a new and exciting "Summary" tab
to the worksheet.  That shows when the wires are made and my summary
purchases for the month.  One thing I don't have access to is any
information that identifies the wire.

Jim, Pete, Shawn, let me know if you have anything you would like me to
add to this worksheet and go ahead and hit Jim up for a free lunch.
That's what I plan to do.

I'm not sure what you mean by valid.  We are not physically flowing any of this gas right now.  There are some small Appalachian producers on here that are still up in the air but we will probably reject those contracts anyway.

We (EES) have  been getting December production payments ready -- what are your thoughts on  actually paying the post-petition pieces?   Besides Dominion,  we have producers off of Gatherco, Columbia Natural Resources,   Columbia Gas Transmission, Peoples Natural Gas, and East Ohio  Gas.    Are these on your list to review some day like you  are doing Dominion?     A few producers have called  wanting to know when to expect payment and I just need to know whether to  forge ahead to get caught up in getting their payments in the system, or to  wait in case we have the producers taken out of our pools on all these  pipes/ldc's.   It is a ton of work, and if it doesn't need to  happen, all the better, but if it does need to happen, I need to be working  on it now.    
 
Also, only one  company listed above could provide daily actuals so the others are just  being split by 31 days.    I figured if the producer disputed  his split (if paid), he could provide the back-up to make it more  accurate.  
 
Any comments  will be helpful.  Thanks.

Hi team.  I'm going to set myself up as the Navigator administrator for Enron North America unless someone else wants to do it.  We use Navigator for activity on Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf, Crossroads, and KO Transmission.  I think we also use Navigator to download the invoices.

I'm going to kill all the ID's shown below except mine.  Should I set up anyone else with an ID?

Are there any other Enron companies that you need to look at as far as
Navigator ID's?  If so I can forward that info to you.

Below are two attachments; one for the new admin (you) and one to remove
exiting Nav ids or to add new Nav ids'.

(See attached file: ADD_CHANGE_ADMINISTRATOR_FORM.doc)            (See
attached file: ADD_REMOVE_USER_FORM.doc)


Since Robert Allwein is the current, can you get his signature on the
Change Adm form?  If you can GREAT!.....if not then the form must be
signed by a Notary.  Then you can go ahead and sign the forms to remove any
ids.

You can call me at  1 800 628 4867.  I really appreciate your help in
getting this account cleaned up.

Thanks,

Vickie

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

I never know what contract the deal is under but I can confirm the price and the volumes for the following;

Deal	 	Counterparty					Comment
1192958	Sequent Energy Management, LP 		approved
1198866	Anadarko Energy Services Company		approved
1195770	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved
1195777	MidAmerican Energy Company			Changed price from $2.05 to $2.02 in Sitara per notes from Sylvia Pollan.
1195767	MidAmerican Energy Company			approved
1192959	City of Tallahassee				this should be on deal #30534 - part of the long term contract.

I don't have access to view the other deals but I'm working on it.  I believe I entered the other 2 Anadarko deals in Sitara but either I put them on the wrong desk or they were moved after I entered them because I don't have access to them either. GRRRR.

Scott, Margaret, I changed the price on deal 1195777 (Feb 2002 activity) from $2.05 to $2.02.  We prepaid MidAmerican $1,158,864.00 for all 3 deals shown above.  Not sure who to tell about Sitara changes.

According to Iroq the problem is on our side.  Please call me first think Monday morning at 3-4743.  Following is the address that I'm starting at.  I go to this address and click on "Customer Activities" and that's when I get the error message.  It should ask me for my ID and password.

I'm at ECS 04425 if you decide to come by my desk.  I'm out for the rest of the day.

Thanks

Robert, when you get a chance, please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393.

Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?

Let me know.

I hope I have the right Bob Hall.  I'm trying to get sitara access to the West and Texas Desk and they have not been approved yet.  I'm waiting for Phillip Love (now with UBS) to approve the West and O'Neal Winfree (not sure who this is) to approve the Texas Desk.

Tommy Yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed.

I also left a message for the help desk about this.

Hey, I just saw your email.  I'm still here.  I'm moving my stuff from 6 to 5 today and then I'm going to take the longest vacation of my life.  I may or may not come in tomorrow but I will be out until Jan 2nd.  I'm probably leaving early today too.  I may actually take the first week of Jan off too.  

How are you?  I just called your nubmer and got your voicemail.  I'm glad you have something.  Don't be upset if I don't return your email for awhile.  I'll be on vacation.

Later Gator

Chris,

The last two days the consumption at the plant has been 42,085 MMBtu and 38,852 MMBtu. These are plant reads based on 7am-7am timeframe. Do we need to sell an additional 5,000 MMBtu in order to pull more off of Lonestar??

OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.17 for Thur 4/18/02.  I checked on the price with Darren Farmer at AEP and he said that's where Waha was trading so I don't feel like we are being taken advantage of too much.

Rita,

I am mailing you the original Columbia Gas invoices for Feb and Mar and a copy of what I have for December.  I don't have the January invoices and I have requested a copy from Jeanne Adkins assistant at Columbia Gas.  I will also ask to have these sent to your attention in the future.

I gave Maria a copy of everything I'm mailing to you.


Thanks

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

From:  Human Resources
Re:  First Collection Milestone Achieved

Several weeks ago, we told you we believed we had hit our first cash collection milestone, and indeed we have.  Representatives for the unsecured creditors' committee and the ENA examiner are currently validating our cash collections and we expect them to verify the milestone very soon.  The bankruptcy court judge has also signed the official motion related to the retention and LIP plans, so it is final with no additional follow-up with the court required.  Soon, all the pieces will be in place to make our first Liquidation Incentive Pool dispersement.  Because it will be our first dispersement, we are taking the needed time to establish an accurate and equitable process for this and future payouts.  We plan to hold a meeting with all LIP participants in the next week or two to walk through the procedures we've developed and answer any questions.  We'll be in contact with you soon to schedule that meeting.  

Thank you,
Robert Jones

It was nice of you to put thought and effort into those reviews.  Even if the process seems like a waste of time, you did your part!
I feel so blah today.  I'm tired and sad and have cramps.  I almost turned around and went home when I was on my way to work, but I have so much to do.  I'm hoping to just work quietly today, get my mind off my troubles, and get some things off my plate.
And I love my kitty cat.  He's my precious boo-boo.

OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

I think the pricing should be Trco Index plus commodity plus fuel.  It looks like you just have Index plus commodity on the pricing.

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve this deal so Bridgeline can bill ENA for the storage service.  Normally I wouldn't worry about it but since we are in negotiations with Bridgeline I'm not sure what to do.

Is a confirm generated if I approve this ticket?

Also, when does this deal terminate in the global contracts system?

Subject: RE: Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan


The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Subject:        Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan 

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 


Any comments or questions?

Just a quick note on the information I've sent you.  The following two lines deal with the activity I've been involved in since Dec 2, 2001.  Some of my coworkers have said I should leave these lines out.  What do you think?

?	Buy and sale gas for the Enron Estate Team.
?	Provide commercial evaluations on post-petition deals to legal counsel.

Also, I sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday.

Thanks

Hi everybody. It's Steve Cooper. It's Friday afternoon, March 1. I hope everybody has had a great week. I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop. 
The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion. I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues. Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable. I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues. 
In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund. We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees. I wanted you to be aware of that. I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset. 
Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program. As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification. 
The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee. We provided to them more data. Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28. We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program. 
I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority. It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed. I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court. I'll keep you posted on progress. I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs. Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail. 
The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions. Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week. Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases. And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process. So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases. 
We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract. It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate. I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund. I'd like your input on that. I thought it was a great idea and very generous. 
We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month. Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there. I've tried to get around to say hello here and there. And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz. Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries. 
Other than that I don't have a lot to report. We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program. Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area. I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward. 
One other thing... 
We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon. We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here. We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting. I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron's future. I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting. 
Anyway, as I was saying... 
Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication. I hope you have a great weekend. I'll chat with next week.

Ex:  I've been buying gas from Reliant Energy Services, Inc. each month to serve one of my term markets.  According to Bjorn, the Credit Committee will no longer approve of my prepayments to Reliant for base load supply.

To my knowledge that capacity is still valid.  It's one of Connie Moody's leftover contracts for 117 dth.  

Ruth, I had asked George Linder? at Nat Fule about Nat Fuel taking this capacity back or at least including it in an open season several times.  He never did anything with it.

Chris,

there is also a demand fee of $714.14 that we pay on contract F01978 on National Fuel.  Is that still a valid charge.  The deal number is 1190921.  We are still accruing charges for 2002 on that deal.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Rita

In connection with Deloitte & Touche's annual audit of MGAG, Deloitte & Touche is trying to confirm what MGAG has billed ENA for the year ending December 31, 2001.  I would normally send this request directly to settlements.  However, it is my understanding that all request should be coordinated through you due to our circumstance.  

If I don't hear from you by 2:30 PM this afternoon, I will send you the 13 page fax I received from Deloitte & Touche and I will give them your name and number as the contact person to comply with their requests.

When I look at my position manager for TP3 on 1st-4th, its short by 9189.  TCO is long by 9189 for the same time frame.

Part of the problem is deal 1016655.  I can see that the volumes on the deal for the 1st thru the 4th, but they don't show up in Unify.  These volumes also do not show up on my P&L.  My unaccounted volume on TP3 for September is (36,846  roughly 9189 x 4 days).

TRCO Team,  would you changed the pathed volume in Unify on this deal for the 1st thru the 4th by 1dt please?  I would like to see if that has an impact.

Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW.

There are no quotes out there... just for Enron's info.

I'll be in town this weekend.. going to TCO/Gulf meeting Monday and
Tuesday.
Hope to see you.

Hope your back and other aches are okay.

Just following up on this item as I have tried to process these adjustments and
they have not been zeroed in Sitara yet.  If I need to send these to someone

Chris,

Here are the adjustments that need to be made in Sitara for November 2001

Please "Zero" out the Demand charges for the following deals :

118129
352617

I had Phillip Love enter these prior to the bankruptcy.  These are items we would have collected and then
repaid to other parties on behalf of the State of Florida.  Since we were unable to do that, these charges need
to be removed.  If you have any other questions, please call me.

Thanks,
Max

P.S.  I will be sending your pricing adjustments for December 2001 soon.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

I'm leaving for the day.  All of my notes are on the word document.

I just spoke with my contact at Columbia Gas and she suggested that we call Columbia Gas's in-house counsel to discuss the issue.  I just update my word document with that information.

Steve, you may receive this email before I get to your office.  I will hand deliver the following items;
1.  The word document attached to this email
2.  Copy of the Columbia Gas PAL and FTS rate shedule from their tariff
3.  Copies of the 2 PAL's contracts that ENA is trying to utilize
4.  A copy of 1 of our FTS contracts
5.  Select sheets from Columbia Gas's tariff that apply to Creditworthiness.

Ed, I will be in on Wednesday to resolve this issue.  Then I will be taking ALL OF MY 2000 vacation until it runs out, which will be sometime during the second week of Jan.

Well, I told Ingird that I was madly in love with you but that you constantly rejected my advances.

AND I DO provide her with love and support.  I'm all over this marriage thing and I told her "no more lovin until she makes and honest married man outta me".  We get our new apartment on Feb 22 and she be living together by Mar 1st.  Don't know if I'll be a married man by then or not.  We are going to look for a cute little chapel type thing this weekend.  I'm still trying to make her cat disappear.  I'm telling her if that cat leaves one mark on my little Christopher or Audrey, out the cat goes.

I don't think the triggers are correct.

Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.  Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?  One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.  We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.  These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.

Please check into deals 332163 and 340305 for sales invoices to Midland Cogen.  Max Doner thought these deals would not trigger activity anymore per your note to him on 5/13.  I see where these deals were updated by you on that date.  Are the deals legit, or are the triggers generated legit.  Please let me know ASAP.

I had Phillip Love enter these prior to the bankruptcy.  These are items we would have collected and then
repaid to other parties on behalf of the State of Florida.  Since we were unable to do that, these charges need
to be removed.  If you have any other questions, please call me.

Thanks,
Max

P.S.  I will be sending your pricing adjustments for December 2001 soon.

Gentlemen,

	It is my understanding that Enron Representative Chris German
informed Tallahassee Representative Pam McCullers, earlier this morning that
Enron would not be scheduling gas to Tallahassee pursuant to subject
agreement for the month of June.  If this is indeed the case and Enron does
not schedule gas with Tallahassee by 9:00 a.m. Eastern Prevailing Time
tomorrow, May 31, 2002, Tallahassee will seek replacement supplies from
alternative sources.

	Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me or Pete Koikos, Director of Energy Services.

Did you submit a request for access.  I will approve.

You can not have access to AEP info however.

I hope I have the right Bob Hall.  I'm trying to get sitara access to the West and Texas Desk and they have not been approved yet.  I'm waiting for Phillip Love (now with UBS) to approve the West and O'Neal Winfree (not sure who this is) to approve the Texas Desk.

Tommy Yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed.

Greetings,

Thanks for the TV. and Jaime also said Thanks for the bed room suite.
Chris, I found Dad's old pistol.  It was under the dresser in his bed room.
I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left.  It is
captured in a pistol storage case.  I stuck it in behind the sheets and
things.  I saw Chad and Angela on my way out.  They are a great couple.
Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work.  I am going
to get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if he
wants to lease Dad's pasture.
As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year.  You had said we do not want to
pay for a fence along the creek.  When I have leased places in the past I
have had to build new fence at my own expense.  Most folk's base their
cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation.  If I built fence
and that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,
then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,
excluding my labor.  Something to think about.  I hope we do not own that
place for five more years.  Gerald also said he would mow the grass around
the house and sort of keep the place tuned up.

Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead.  They placed her in
Angleton/Danbury for overnight observation.  I think she required about
seven stitches in her head.  There were x-rays taken and her lungs are
pretty much gone.  Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech can
read his prints.

Stopped by and saw Bernie Max.  Now where did they come up with a name like
that?  They removed the lymph glands from his neck.  Starting down the torso
just at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down the
torso about six or seven inches.  A triangle shape about the size of a piece
of large pizza.  The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep into
his body.  The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue.  They took a pretty
big chunk out of his chest.  He had a six " x eight " piece of skin removed
from his left thing for a skin graft.  It looked pretty painful.  He was in
good spirits and bull corning around.

I guess that is about it.  I would like to have a timber appraisal performed
on the Dad's place.  I'll be chatting with you guys.  Oh, I forgot the dang
remote to the TV.  I really was not for sure which one it was.  I think I
need it to program the darn thing.  Keep your powder dry.

Y'all be safe,

don

Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed
by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a
termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't
include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting
with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original
agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this
lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW.

AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.

The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following

Sales Price		$5.4850
Transport to Stoi	$.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident)
Storge Injection		$.0249
Capacity Demand	$.0400

Total Price		$5.7025

We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).

Thanks

I received your fax.

Questions:  at the top of the page from Dominion, it states that "effective FEBRUARY 2002 Production ... WILL NOT BE CREDITED".  One of the column titles on the sheet is EFFECTIVE DATE.  What does this effective date stand for.

Also, were you able to find a contract for The Central Pacific Group?

The CIA had an opening for an assassin. After all of the background checks, interviews, and testing were done there were three finalists...2 men and a woman.

For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!" The man said, "You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife." The agent said, "Then you are not the right man for this job."

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. "I tried, but I can't kill my wife." The agent said, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."

Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair."

Moral: Women are evil. Don't mess with them.

I just validated and saved this release to Boston Gas.  Since I have not done this in awhile, would you please make sure I did the following things?

Thanks.

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

                                         deal on Florida





I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

This is what I want to send to our "Team".  Would you please do a quick review just before I send it out?


These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing and additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.



Chris's notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

Pete,  I'm following up the voicemail I left you this morning.
 
In our initial discussions you indicated we could do business under an existing GISB agreement between Enron North America and Reliant.  However, our legal department believes all of our GISB contracts with Reliant have been cancelled/terminated.  Attached is a standard GISB agreement for your review.  I understand that you need to send this to your legal department to include any special provisions that may be necessary.   
 
Please call me at 713-853-4743 or Eric Boyt at 713-345-7754 and let me know if Reliant Energy Services is willing to trade under this agreement.
 
Thanks
Chris Germany

Released 100% of the volume biddable to Boston Gas and max rate.

Gloria Barkowsky has access to Escript, but she is on vacation this week. I don't know if someone else in Volume Management has access (Rita??).  

Dominion used to send data files to us that, in addition to "current" month allocations and meter statements, may have included imbalance information.

Kathryn (EES Volume Management) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers  for EES.  Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department.  We may have to do that anyway.  I'm not sure what this report is called, I just know its on a 2 month lag.  I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB).  If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me.  If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.

Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this.  If the person that handled Dominion is gone, then I'll just go the "legal" route.

Thanks

37147	IPP agreement - our pooling contract.
39149  AS agreement - 
66917  AS agreement - 

I think the AS agreements are aggregation supply and I believe the wellhead meters were attached to these contracts to help with allocations and billing.  I not 100% sure so I left a message for our CGAS contact to verify.

 All, 
 
 Linda Anderson, just called Ed McMichael's line and wanted to advise us that Central Pacific's well 
 release was not included in the fax to Dominion.  
 
 Can one of you give her a call and help her resolve this issue?
 
 Her number is 559 294-3373. 
 
 If you could please let me know who will follow-up, I would appreciate it.

Steve Stonestreet at CGAS did verify that metered production on CGAS is "attached" to the AS (aggregation service) contracts, and from there you would schedule it to a transport contract or into the IPP contract.  CGAS and Dominion work very similar when talking about metered production.

our distinct personality, The Shepherd is to tend to your human flock. You understand the needs of those for whom you are responsible. Shepherds are vigilant and reliable. You realize your obligation and commitment to the well being of those entrusted to your care. Shepherds are very dependable. You engender a feeling of comfort and stability to those within your charge. On the positive side, Shepherds can be empathic, caring, understanding, practical and realistic. On the negative side, you may be manipulative, close-minded and sentimentally rigid. Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms.

Don't forget about me.  I'm still trying to find out what it will take to move gas on and ENA tabs agreement.  No transportation at this point, just a tabs.  Also, it will be much easier for you guys to monitor because most of the deals will be monthly.

Hi Chris,

My name is Joan Morgan and I do the capacity release here at Keyspan
(Boston Gas).  Next month and thereafter when you do the assignment of
the Iroquois contract (volume 35,465 dth), instead of using Liz Danehy
as the bidder contact, will you use my name?  The telephone number and
fax will remain the same.  My e-mail address is
jmorgan@keyspanenergy.com.

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions concerning this.

The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).  I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price.

Hi Chris,

I realize that you are getting bugged from a few of us in Canada for the Boston Differential numbers.  I am in Accounting and I am in desperate need of the Boston Differential for August and September so that I can finish my invoicing for the month.  I really have to have these numbers by the end of the day today (latest).  Sorry for being a pest, but I am starting to panic!  Please send these numbers to me or Nicole Laporte, as soon as possible.

We just require August and September, we already have July.
Would it possible to get the differential number before Wednesday? Our Accounting group requires this number for invoicing and they are a few weeks late with their August invoice and require the differential immediately.
Please let me know,

Sorry about the delay.  I'm starting to look at this again.  I know you need August and September.  Did you say you also need July?  

I don't know if Canada makes any money off this deal but my book is taking a beating.  Ruth Concannon and I are meeting Wednesday to discuss this deal.  There are some other things going on with this deal that she is aware of.  I should have your prices by them.

Steve, everything looks good with one exception.  The rate schedule on Tennessee should be either NET-2 or NET-284.  I won't find out until Monday.  You review and approve it, keep it on your desk, and I will come over and make the change at your desk on Monday.  Then I'll take it to Ed for his approval.

Chris,

      I spoke with Rochelle from MCV on Monday morning roughly 9:30am, and she went into her system and verified to me that we did not cut them, that they did receive the 8500mm's that they requested on Sunday March 18th. She assured me that they received all volumes they requested.

I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?
 
Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

Dan Leff floor presentation on Friday March 22nd, 10:00 AM
came here 5 years ago, Mechanical enigeer, sold his business FMES in 1997 to EES and been with EES every since.

we have about 1,000 people left in wholesale and retail
about 800 people in support groups
we've lost about 7,000 people since Dec 2nd.

3 things
1.  where is the business now
we know where we are, where we are going, retention\
pooled wholesale and retail resources
figure out how to get the people together

we've completly revamped the sr management team
target recovery of $6 billion dollars for the estate team, this is not a book value or firesell value.
$3 bill in ENA, $1.4 EES  $600 mill enron canada.....so forth.
stan hortin   mike mcconnel looking at packaging deal and assets together to develope a new reorganized company.

2.
we are important, the people that is
all the difficult times are behind us
he understands our urge to leave
take a deep breath, think about how what you do will enhance career.

retention plan should be presented next week, will be filed next week with the bankruptcy court.
creditor's committee has approved the retention plan

plan brings substantial amount of money to bear 
jobs may change
email will go out next week detailing plan
management will talk to people before next friday about how the overall retention plan will impact us and our coworkers


Liquidation bucket - people settleing terminated positions, assets, primarily commercial oriented.  Commision type environment.
Retention Pool - cetain amount of money is paid on a qtrly basis.
Severeance plan - safety net for people not in retention or liguidation bucket.
anyone in severance plan will have their monies offset by any monies they recieve  on one of the other plans.

3.
personal message 
be positive
have some fun
get a bounce back in your walk
you can be part of fixing it
take next year or 2 years to learn and develope.

queston:  what is the goal of the company
we are selling books of business, assets, and substantial amount of backoffice work needs to be done to do the settlements.
we are not going to try and develope new business.

question:  org chart?
We should be developing one over the next few weeks.

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

I've requested a prepayment for Wed in the amount of $42,000.00 due the rise in cash prices.  I've also added a new and exciting "Summary" tab to the worksheet.  That shows when the wires are made and my summary purchases for the month.  One thing I don't have access to is any information that identifies the wire.  

Jim, Pete, Shawn, let me know if you have anything you would like me to add to this worksheet and go ahead and hit Jim up for a free lunch.  That's what I plan to do.

Steve Menke said you would know the answer.

I purchased capacity from Steve last October.  The terms were as follows;
Release Date	11/1/2001 through 3/31/2002
Volume		18,000 dth
Contract	T0181230000
Offer		#200110000095

Steve said he thought they recalled this capacity.  Would you see if it was recalled and if it was, what was the effective date of the recall.

Thanks

I know you told me that this capacity could be released.  Can it be released in 4 seperate peices?  Plus I may be doing permanent releases too.  Any problem with that?  Does this contract have an evergreen clause?

Subject:	Employee Assistance Program - Workshops Scheduled


Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm
	3:30 pm --   4:30 pm

No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.

Onsite Confidential Counseling / 24 Hour Hotline
EAP Counselors are available for individual, confidential appointments onsite in the Enron Building or at a variety of neighborhood locations.  Counselors are also available via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week for Enron employees in all locations.  The EAP counseling service is provided at no cost to employees and their family members.  To schedule an appointment or speak with a counselor, please call the onsite office at 713-853-6057 or the 24-hour number at 1-800-345-1391.

I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule.  AS (tariff sheet #205) and IPP
(tariff sheet #215) are separate rate schedules in the tariff.  AS pools
are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a
specific geographical location on the pipeline.  AS pool meters can be used
as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP
Pool meters are not.

To:  Enron Employees Worldwide
From:  Steve Cooper
I am disappointed to announce the resignation of Cindy Olson as executive vice president of Human Resources and Employee Relations, effective July 15, 2002.  After nearly 25 years with Enron, Cindy has decided to leave to assist her husband in his trucking and transportation business.  Her commitment and enthusiasm, even during these difficult times, have been inspiring and will be missed.
Robert Jones, managing director in Human Resources, will assume Cindy's responsibilities and join Enron's Management Committee.  Robert joined Enron in 1980 and has held numerous managerial positions.  Prior to Enron's bankruptcy, Robert led Human Resources for Enron Wholesale Services.  Robert was instrumental in developing the retention and severance plan that was ultimately approved by the creditors' committee and the court.  His experience and leadership will be invaluable as we move forward in our restructuring efforts.

I'm working on my contact list.  It looks like I'll have better luck after lunch.  FP&L asked me to call back after lunch.  Judy said that Scott Neal just doesn't want to talk about it till after trading.

Interesting note (and I'm keeping track of my notes)  AEP will not buy gas from Enron.  I spoke to Elsa Villarreal (works for Houston Pipeline).  She called Todd Lambert in her Columbus office and Todd told Elsa that AEP will not buy gas from Enron.

I'll keep you guys posted on my Bridgeline notes through out the day.

I'll write up an IOL trouble ticket at our end and I will have our IT guy to
call you and help you with the access.

And I have another question:  who at Enron should be receiving invoices?  Could
you please tell me.  It used to go to Ryan Keith.  Is he still there?  If not,
who should the person be?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

No I am not.  Donna Grief called me on Monday concerning this and I told her we would need Commercial's blessing and then approval by the cash committee.  I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.  I'm not really sure what group should handle it.  Is there an invoice that you can get to me so that I can have it as backup support for the cash request?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate.

I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?

Thanks

Deal 1035543, a sale to Giant Refining Company, was terminated effective 12/1/01.  It looks like the Trk Nom and Schd volumes should be taken out.

Chris / Shemin / Ruth,

Here's a brief recap of what happened on the Dominion issues from the EES side. I would like to get an idea of where we stand with them now and make sure I coordinate with the ENA counsel and ENA's position with Dominion. Basically I want to make sure we address our "frozen" storage and decide how best to resolve the local producers issue ( when to pay and from what date ).

	Basically the chronology from the EES is as follows :

Prior to Dec 2001, EES had storage capacity and Dominion transport released to us from Niagara Mohawk ( NIMO) for our customers behind that LDC. Over the summer of 2001 we injected approx. 680,000 dthms which should be worth $2.4 MM now.
Upon declaration of bankruptcy NIMO terminated our ability to serve customers behind the LDC as a result of the NY PUC ruling.
Also upon bankruptcy Dominion Transmission terminated all our transportation contracts including the transport for the storage capacity we had from NIMO. Dominion then took the position that our gas was frozen and could be used as an offset against the amounts we owed them.
Marshall Turner and Melanie turner of Weil Gotshal have been in discussions with the counsel for Dominion, Bill Saviers ( Internal ) Paul Vrana and Bruce Ruzinsky of Jackson Walker ( external )
One of the issues in dispute is whether Dominion can offset the value of our storage gas against payables due from ENA. I don't know if this has been resolved.

Gloria Barkowsky has access to Escript, but she is on vacation this week. I don't know if someone else in Volume Management has access (Rita??).  

Dominion used to send data files to us that, in addition to "current" month allocations and meter statements, may have included imbalance information.

Kathryn (EES Volume Management) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers  for EES.  Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department.  We may have to do that anyway.  I'm not sure what this report is called, I just know its on a 2 month lag.  I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB).  If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me.  If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.

Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this.  If the person that handled Dominion is gone, then I'll just go the "legal" route.

On Nov 13th, I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th.  I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG.  I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn.  The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am.  The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows Joann changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th?  Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th.

Lia, would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills?

Here is a little more info in the Tenn/Sonat park & loan deal.  The volume is 500,195 dth parked in Bear Creek storage on Tenn contract 15692.  It was suppossed to come out on Sonat this month but we never scheduled it.  Yesterday, Clarissa Garcia tried to schedule some of this gas for today's gas day.  We don't know if Tenn allowed us to schedule it yet.

Summary
There is only 1 Tenn park & loan deal for 500,195
2 Cgas park & loan deals shown below.  We have not scheduled any of the CGAS park & loan deals.

I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now.  This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract.  It is scheduled to come out on Sonat.  To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges.  But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.  I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.


We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.  I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.

Subject:	CGAS Park & Loan deals

We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.

Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.  Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.

According to my calculations, TP1 demand charges should be $1,115,826 for Nov.  Would you change that for me?

We have two firm transportation agreements on Tennessee Pipeline.  The long term Boston Gas capacity release and a short term contract which expires on 1/31/2002.  The monthly demand charge on the short term capacity is $15,200.00.

Do we need to reject the short term capacity before it expires?  To my knowledge, we did not flow any gas on this contract for December or January.

I'm not actively seeking another job and I believe I'll be here to collect that pot of gold next year.  But, I still need a backup for the gas activity.  Unless you tell me to do something different, I'm going to see if Kathy Kelly wants to back me up.

Chris

I checked our tariff and with our in house council and there is nothing that
precludes us from assisting you with marketing this capacity.  In fact, our
tariff provides for it in Section 28.15 of the General Terms & Conditions
(Transporter & Shipper negotiate a "marketing fee" for Transporter to
actively market capacity on behalf of Shipper).  So as not to set a
precedent of doing it for free, I've attached a letter agreement for a token
$1 marketing fee.  What is the protocol (and likelihood) of having something
like this signed?

Once the capacity is offered and a replacement shipper is found, all three
parties would sign a permanent release agreement, a pro forma of which is
also attached.  Basically it outlines who the parties are, what agreements
are in place, and takes all the liability (and right of first refusal) off
of you and puts it on the Replacement Shipper.  Enron has signed a similar
agreement in the past regarding the majority of volumes on the same contract
when it released them to ProGas in 1997.

Please call me to discuss and/or if you need the relevant tariff page faxed
to you.

Steve Menke said you would know the answer. 

I purchased capacity from Steve last October.  The terms were as follows; 
Release Date    11/1/2001 through 3/31/2002 
Volume          18,000 dth 
Contract        T0181230000 
Offer           #200110000095 

Steve said he thought they recalled this capacity.  Would you see if it was recalled and if it was, what was the effective date of the recall.

Thanks

Subject: RE: Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan


The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Subject:        Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan 

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 


Any comments or questions?

I just showed Ed McMichael the sitara position screens for the East and Central Desk for March 1st.  There are volumes all over the place.  I asked him who should be taking these volumes to 0 since most of these deals are not physically flowing.  Ed is going to discuss this in a meeting with Bob Hall today.  

I guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in Sitara or Unify.

Can you guys think of any other questions along those lines?

I'm not sure if it should be terminated but to my knowledge we are not serving this deal so it probably should be terminated.  I'm going to a "terminated contracts" meeting this morning so maybe I will find out more about how this works.  I also don't see any volumes on this deal for March.

Chris,

If you send me an email this afternoon with the estimated amount (I assume it will be $2.1MM) and the net benefit/(cost) to the estate, I will add the amount to the summary for discussion with the Cash Committee on Monday.  If we get the request signed on Monday we should have no problem sending the wire on Tuesday as long as Larry Cash reserves the cash for Tuesday.

Drew, 
 
I need to send out a payment of about $2.1 million next Tuesday to Reliant.  The price is based off the NYMEX settle for today which we won't know until after 3:00 PM.  And I prefer to wait until the day after NYMEX settles so I can see the price in a published document like Gas Daily.  This puts us in a bit of a bind.  

What I can do is prepare the cash request form today based off the NYMEX settle, that means you won't get it from me until after 3:30 PM.  Monday morning I will verify the price in print, and get the signed wire request to you before 10:00 AM assuming Margaret, Ed, and Susan are all available to sign it.  Phil already has an estimate for these amounts on the Gas Cash Forcast worksheet.

Let me know if this works for you.

Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday.  On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.  

Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.

Thanks

Importance:	High

Here is the rest of the information to fill in the below blanks:

a)  Gas prices at TCO's pool for spot gas trades for April 22, 2002 were $3.545 per Dth ---  the midpoint of Gas Daily's Columbia Appalachia price posting.  

b)  ENA did receive various letters from TCO addressing Section 9.5(c) notifications.  The first notice was dated November 28, 2002.  The other two letters memorialized conversations regarding ENA's creditworthiness.  I can fax these to you.

c)  EES appears to not have received letters regarding creditworthiness, or at least I can not find any correspondence.  Apparently, phone conversations did occur that related to the fact that if EES pays their bills that TCO would continue to allow them to do business.  EES has paid their post-petition invoices, with one exception, a billing dispute of $1000 to $1500 that was related to nominating on a contract that had been recalled by the releasing shipper without notice to EES.

d)  Due to the uncertainty of whether TCO was going to allow EES to use the capacity,  EES did not use their capacity in December.  EES did pay the invoice, however, as is noted on Exhibit H.

e)  For providing adequate assurances of performance,  EES did not have to put up anything special, like a guaranty or a letter of credit.  TCO has been requiring that EES maintain a minimum volume balance on EES's OBA, Operational Balancing Agreement, for their pool.  TCO has indicated that 71,766 Dth should be the minimum OBA balance for April 2002.  EES's OBA balance as of April 21, 2002 is 36,647 Dth.  Based on current forecasts, EES's ending OBA balance will be 46,876 Dth, so EES will have to go out and purchase additional supplies to maintain TCO's April 2002 minimum balance of  71,766 Dth.  This is the only thing that is happening that can be deemed a "frozen parking balance".

f)  We can not find the misplaced invoice that would nail down how much gas may be due ENA in Item #8.  Just go with at least 62,000 Dth.

g)  EES has not really been harmed in that they have been prevented in making sales.  Maintaining the minimum OBA balance has just increased their operating costs.

h)  On Ed's affidavit, the above changes need to be made.  Also please decide whether, the letters that I am faxing you really over-ride many of the notification arguments that you are trying to make.

Subject:	High Level Comments to Columbia Gas Round II Motion

I recommend that your draft response and Ed's affidavit be revised.  There are many inaccuracies in TCO's Round II Motion.  Here are my high level comments for:

TCO's Round II Motion

#1)  ENA's and EES's situation are completely different.

#2)  When TCO's Round I Motion was filed gas on TCO was supposedly trading at $2.285 per Dth on February 11, 2002.  Gas is now trading at around $3.60 - $3.70 per Dth.  This is not a typo.  Prices are up by over $1.30 per Dth since early February, but who knows how long they are going to stay there.  I will be able to get a better number on Monday morning.  By all these court delays, TCO has actually made us some money.

#3)  For the post-petition period, ENA has not been using its firm transportation contracts and has not paid TCO's invoices for PAL, FTS, OPT-60, or IGS (i.e. interruptible gathering service that is used to aggregate supply like the Dominion producers) -- See Exhibit C "ENA Chart".

#4)  ENA has two PALS agreements with stranded park balances (PAL K# 67401& PAL K# 70457); three temporary capacity release contracts that were acquired from several different parties (OPT-60 K# 71451 released from Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership, FTS K# 70285 released from Columbia Energy Services Corporation & subsequently re-released back to New Power, FTS K# 70357 released from The New Power Company); one FTS agreement that originally was acquired from a third party (i.e. the marketing affiliate of TCO) and later converted over to ENA during the contract rollover process (FTS K# 70197); two FTS agreements that were acquired from TCO, the pipeline, through a capacity auction (FTS K# 67133 & FTS K# 67207); and one IGS agreement where additional commodity charges have been invoiced during the post-petition period -- Exhibit C.

#5)  Interestingly, Exhibit C does not show K# 71451, K# 70285 (demand & credit) are capacity relase deals acquired by ENA.  To the extent ENA does not pay, TCO should be billing the releasing shipper.  In fact, K# 71451 is the 40,000 Dth/d OPT-60 contract that has been referred to in the CALP, Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership, Stipulation that Weil has already filed with the court.  The recall of this temporary capacity release contract occurred on March 20, 2002.  TCO should be billing CALP for both the pre-petition and the post-petition reservation charges not paid by ENA and the full charges from the effective date of the capacity recall.  By my count, those amounts are $131,063.20 pre-petition and $362,423.00 post-petition, or about 35% of TCO's pre-petition and post-petition claims -- ex. Paragraph 5, 8, 9...

#6) Paragraph 6 is misleading.  On November 30, 2001, ENA nominated a 10,000 Dth/d nomination for December 1st through 31st, or a total of 310,000 Dth, the entire balance of parked gas under PAL K# 67401.  This agreement was going to terminate on December 31, 2001 and ENA wanted to zero out the balance by the termination date.  TCO refused to accept the nominations so the ratable gas deliveries of 10,000 Dth/day for 31 days were not scheduled into ENA pooling account with TCO and could not be sold in the December 2001 spot gas market.  Interestingly, TCO continued to invoice ENA for the PAL charges even though TCO was holding our gas -- ex. Exhibit C.

#7)  ENA also tried to nominate a portion of the parked gas, 10,000 Dth/day, on January 2nd for Gas Day January 3rd deliveries.  Once again TCO did not accept ENA's nomination and no parked gas was scheduled for January 3rd.  The end result was that the parked gas could not be used as a source of gas supply to perform under an existing sales agreement with Columbia of Ohio, one of the many sales agreements in ENA's portfolio of contracts.

#8)  ENA continues to be invoiced commodity charges under the IGS agreement for the post-petition period.  This leads to the question, what has TCO done with ENA's gas that the small producers have been delivering into ENA's IGS agreement and why have we not seen any accounting of these volumes?  I am missing one month's invoice but I am guessing that the volumes should be around 62,000 to 77,000 Dth.  I will have to get this nailed down Monday morning.  Also, volumes that are non-gathered are aggregated separately.  TCO would have to provide this volume information.

#9)  For the post-petition period, EES has been using its FTS, SST, SIT and IGS contracts in order to continue to serve its markets.  EES has been paying the pipeline, either monthly or on a pre-pay basis  --  See Exhibit H "EES Chart"

#10)  I doubt the pipeline allowed EES to continue to do business without providing adequate assurances of performances -- ex. Paragraph 11, 21...  I will have to check on Monday what exactly was done.

#11)  Since EES has been using their capacity and paying their bills during the post-petition period, I do not understand how TCO can both accept nominations for EES's pool gas and freeze the pool balance simultaneously -- ex. Paragraph 12...  I will have to get more info from EES on Monday.

#12)  Value of pool gas should be at current conditions -- ex. Paragraph 13...  Exact opposite of the pricing support to the argument in Paragraph 21 has actually occurred.

#13)  Exhibit H shows the supposed $2,104,463.31 revenue that will be lost by TCO as a result of EES breaching its contracts.  Contract breach?  Once again, EES continues to use and pay the invoices for its contracts since the petition date.  Wouldn't it be likely for this situation to continue until the end of the terms of the agreements, or that these agreements could be assigned or released to another party if it is decided that EES terminates its retail sales off TCO -- ex. Paragraph 14... 

ENA's & EES's Response to TCO Round II Motion

#1)  Assuming I am correct on the EES pooling, ENA's and EES's situation are completely different and in the majority of the cases should not be lumped together generically as Debtors or the estate.

#2)  Loans are made for a variety of reasons (e.g. imbalance management, TCO wanting to reduce its current line pack or inventory, etc.) -- Paragraph 6...

#3)  Once again, holding EES's pool gas does not make sense since EES appears to be all paid up.  I will get this confirmed Monday morning -- Paragragh 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21...

#4)  For the first time that we can recall, TCO is also using Sec 9.7 of their tariff to also address the issue of storage customers who are outside the contractual limitations of their storage agreements.  Chris Germany just sent out a notice where TCO announced a gas sales auction to sell off a small volume of gas that fell in this category.  The volume was so small, it is hard to believe that TCO could even see it in their day-to-day operations.  My guess is they are trying to set a precedent to make a point -- Paragraph 26, 27, 28, 29, 30...

#5)  Notices to suspend performance on account of non-payment?  I do not know if written notices were sent to ENA.  I will have to check Legal's termination letter file on Monday morning.  For EES, since they are paying I don't know how they can be included in this argument.  Chris and Robin both talked with TCO when the nominations were not accepted.  Supposedly, TCO verbally stated that the need for payment assurances was the reason the parked gas was not scheduled -- Paragraph 37, 38, 39... 

#6)  Paragraph 38 needs to be updated as described above in Item #6 and #7

Ed McMichael's Round II Affidavit

#1)  Paragraph 1, should you also include "EES"s"

#2)  Paragragh 4, see above information described in Item #6 and #7

#3)  Now that I have had a chance to read the Exhibits to Ed's Affidavit, Paragragh 5 as originally drafted looks fine.

#4)  Once again, I will get back to you on Paragraph 6

#5)  Once again, I will get back to you on Paragraph 9 and 11

It's the first day of school in Houston and the teacher thought she'd
get  to know the kids by asking them their name and what their father does
for a  living.

The first little girl says: "My name is Mary and my daddy is a postman."

The next little boy says: "I'm Andy and my Dad is a mechanic."

Then one little boy says: "My name is Jimmy and my father is a striptease
dancer in a cabaret for gay men."

The teacher gasps and quickly changes the subject, but later in the
school yard the teacher approaches Jimmy privately and asks if it was really
true that his Dad dances nude in a gay bar  He blushed and said,
"I'm sorry but my dad is an

	OR

 and I was just too embarrassed to say so."

I've called PanCanadian, e prime, Cinergy, Reliant, Coral, ONEOK, and Entergy-Koch.  I'm waiting for most of these people to call me back.  The only positive response I've had is from Coral and he still doesn't know if he can sell us gas even if we prepay.  ONEOK is the only counterparty that said they will NOT do business with us because we owe them $40 million.

Today we learned that Bridgeline sent comfort letters to their customers, informing their customers that Bridgeline will NOT sell us gas.

Margaret, it looks like Monday may be another fire drill day but I promise to keep working on it until 1) I have two suppliers that will work with ENA or 2) I've run out of customers to call.

Nothing so far.  Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them.  It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.  I don't think PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.  Joe or I will be calling them first thing this morning.  

Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend.

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

Chris,

So far no payment from TXU. We probably should set up something with Apache and Williams but essentially we are selling their own gas back to them!!

Please copy me on your spreadsheet for April activity and I'll make sure TXU gets billed correctly.

I want to send out an email showing the TXU sales for the month.  I'm going to copy TXU and kinda use this as an informal confirmation of the monthly activity.  I just want to verify that it is Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. billing TXU correct?

Also, have we received payment for Feb yet?  If not, I would question whether TXU is really going to pay, its starting to sound like a stall technique.  If we need someone else to sell the gas too, we might set up contracts with Apache and Williams and start selling the gas back to them.  Then you would at least have some purchases to net the sales with.

Just a thought before I hop off to lunch.

good luck.  when is comes to daycares.  it probably good to look at quite a few to have a sense of what's out there.  another place you could look is   st. andrews presb.  at buffalo speedway and bissonet.  when i looked at that place it was for a three year old and it appeared very nurturing.  it is or was an accredited facility. 
Barbe, Robin says:
that facility really didn't have much of an academic program.  at this age it doesn't matter but i nicer to have them in an environment that fits all needs now and later,.  it better not to move kids alot.

him at work. Paul has been looking for an experienced transport person
forever. I know he really likes Scott (CES boy used to sit next to you)...
maybe paul is working on him. I think he likes steve gillsbie too.

I'll pass this on to the appropriate person!!! Meet me at the shark club in

   I like to have all options open. Look for jobs and work on getting
   something
   lined up. If a company really wants you... they will wait for you. Lot's
   of
   times they will pay you the cash that you are waiting for at your
   current
   company... severance/bonus... etc.

   We are looking for folks.. you can send me your resume. They need
   traders,
   capacity folks, schedulers, and of course my errand boy too. Finally, we
   are
   starting to expand since bankruptcy is behind us!!!

   Sure.  I'll be there Monday morning.  Ingrid woudl probably like it too.
   What would you have me do?

   Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA.  Talk
   about a
   change in location.  I thought that was nice of him to offer though.

   So what do you think?  Wait and see if there is any severance, maybe a

Man those steaks I cooked Saturday were great.   Bought six Rib Eyes, amn
were they good.   I hurt myself.  Barb had to use the big tractor to move

to eat all those steaks alone.

Not really, we did not have steaks, well not till Sunday when Barb and I
went to El Tora.   We are going t BBQ July Fourth if you guys would like to
come.   Chance is coming in from teh Navy so thought we might cook some.
Dennis and Janice are coming down also.   Figure we will have baked beans,
potatoe salad, few deserts.   Maybe even home made Ice Cream.   You guys
are invited.   Should be lots of babies there.  (New Borns).   I have the
jet ski setting by the water on the bank and will drop the poontoonn boat
in this weekend for riding up ad down the Bayou.

See ya,

Oh yeah Chris, when you called last night Barb and I were out riding the
Scooter around.   Just Chilling.  We rode around looking at houses, yards

I have some really bad news.  My little girl, when she makes a frown face,
she looks just like her Uncle Jerry.  I think that's a very bad sign.

She weighs 7 lbs 4 ozs as of today.

I just showed Ed McMichael the sitara position screens for the East and Central Desk for March 1st.  There are volumes all over the place.  I asked him who should be taking these volumes to 0 since most of these deals are not physically flowing.  Ed is going to discuss this in a meeting with Bob Hall today.  

I guess my next question is should the volume be taken to 0 in Sitara or Unify.

Can you guys think of any other questions along those lines?

I'm not sure if it should be terminated but to my knowledge we are not serving this deal so it probably should be terminated.  I'm going to a "terminated contracts" meeting this morning so maybe I will find out more about how this works.  I also don't see any volumes on this deal for March.

Mr. Cooper,

First, I would like to thank you for all that you have done so far while here at Enron.  Although it has been difficult to continually hear one bad news story after another, it has been refreshing to finally learn the truth and be given the opportunity to make judgments and decisions based upon reality rather than some pipe dream that was being offered.  I truly feel that with your leadership, Enron is heading in the right direction and is slowly making progress in building back credibility.  

Second, as an employee in the LIP pool, I do however, have a couple of questions.  It has now been over three weeks since we received an update from Robert Jones regarding reaching the first $500,000,000 milestone.  In that update it was mentioned that there were some administrative issues that needed to be addressed with regards to the first distribution.  Are we any closer to resolving those issues and do we have an estimated time for that first distribution?  Second, do we have any idea today of how much money has overall been brought in to the estate that is to be used in determining the funding of the LIP pool?

Thank you so much for your time.

Kathy Kelly

P.S. We are greatly appreciative and happy about the reinstatement of the 401K matching.  Thanks again!

Subject: FW: A Little Humor to Start Your Day 


Computer Gender 

An English teacher was explaining to the students 
the 
concept of gender 
association in the English language; noting how 
hurricanes at one time were 
given only female names, and how ships and planes 
were 
usually referred to 
as "she." One of the students raised her hand and 
asked, 
"What gender is a 
computer?" 

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class 
into two 
groups:  males 
in one, females in the other, and asked them to 
decide if 
a computer should 
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked 
to give 
four reasons for 
their recommendations. 

    The group of women concluded that computers 
should be 
referred to as 
masculine because: 

1. In order to get their attention, you have to 
turn them 
on. 

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless. 

3. They are supposed to help you solve your 
problems, but 
half the time, 
they ARE the problem. 

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, 
if you 
had waited a 
little longer, you could have had a better model. 

    The men, on the other hand, decided that 
computers 
should definitely be 
referred to as feminine because: 

1. No one but their creator understands their 
internal 
logic. 

2. The native language they use to communicate 
with other 
computers is 
incomprehensible to everyone else. 

3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in 
long-term 
memory for later 
retrieval. 

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you 
find 
yourself spending half 
your paycheck on accessories for it.

I am requesting a payment to Dominion Oklahoma (aka Louis Dreyfus) in the amount of $10,334.67.  This payment is for gas that flowed in Feb 2002 to the City Of Tallahassee.  According to Max Doner, ENA billed Tallahassee for the incremental volumes and Tallahassee paid for the gas.

Doug, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.  I will get the wire request from settlements, attach the supporting documents, get Ed's signature, and leave it with Susan.  I assume Susan will pass it on to one of you after she approves it.  Is that how the process works these days?

Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday.  On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.  

Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.

Thanks

Kay, per my voicemail, I need to meet with you, Ed, Shemin, and Wade to discuss how to handle producers that are still "attached" to ENA's pools on Dominion Pipeline.  This should be a short (less than 30 minutes) meeting.  Shemin and I are available anytime Monday after lunch.  I believe Ed is available after lunch as well.  Please let Daniel and I know when you are available after lunch on Monday and Daniel will get us a conference room.

Thanks

I spoke with Steve Stonestreet at Columbia Gas.  He will do a conference call with us tomorrow.  I told him it would probably be around our lunch time.  He said that is fine.  I can set up a time tomorrow.  His boss, Jeanne Adkins, told him she doesn't need to be there if we are just talking about the mechanics of how the producer gas flows.

I just got a call from Kevin Hyatt, Director of Marketing at TW.  He said that Sempra just called him and wanted to know why WE locked the points on the contract in our posting.  I told him we locked them because we didn't want to get billed a potentially higher rate.

1)  This guy acted like he knew me and of course I was embarrassed so I acted like I knew him, AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER TALKING TO THIS GUY.  He knew that I had gone to EES and that was back in 1997-1998.

2)  Sempra told Kevin that we would get more value if we let someone change the points.  I wonder, even though we might get billed max rate, would it be possible to allow the replacement shipper to change the points for "the term of the release only AND the releasing shipper would be billed more that max rate" and that way the capacity would go back to its original contract points in October.

Just a thought.

Melissa verified receipt of our $45,000.00 wire yesterday.  Thanks Melissa.

You should receive the following wires today.
$683,835.20 for baseload gas on Trunkline (6,800 dth x 31 days x $3.244)
$1,365,767.00 for baseload gas on Florida (13,000 dth x 31 days x $3.389)

Our current swing gas cash balance is $81,700.00 so we may not send another wire until next week.

Also, Robin Barbe will be my backup when I'm out.  Her number is 713-853-7177.

Thanks

Cullen and Dykman (attorneys for Boston Gas Company) approved all of our changes on the agreement to release the Tenn and Iroq space back to Boston Gas.  They also made one other change, they are taking out the "subject to recall" language at the bottom of page 2 under item #1.

They will be sending the revised document to me.  I will deliver it to you for your approval.

Hey Uncle, 
Thank you guys for the email and thanks for coming to the ordination ceremony.  How did your interview go?  We will be in town this Monday or Tuesday night.  Tuesday would probably be easier on us, because we will be driving back in from Dallas on Monday, but either would work fine. 
Just let us know.

Just Wade and I chatting with Shemin.  We tried calling Dominion's Bankruptcy counsel, outside counsel (which is seperate), and in house counsel and couldn't get anyone.  I believe Shemin has a much better idea though.  BUT, I think its important to note that those producer agreements are Enfolio contracts.

of those letters you are talking about down below.

Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.
Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd?? and terminate the pools without
Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.  You and Patricia can
decide if you want to come.

Hey, I don't think you should show any cash flow for the Enbridge storage until I talk to them this afternoon.  I'm writing an email to you and a few others about what I think we should forcast and I want to talk to them first.  But between you and me, I'm thinking we show about $600,000 or so.

FYI:  Pipeline name change.  Not sure who this might impact.  At least I don't see any deals in Sitara on this pipeline.

There will be a quiz tomorrow afternoon at 4:45 PM.

Subject:	Pipeline Name Change, effects Global Facility & Global Contracts

Okay, not sure who, if anyone, cares or needs to know BUT . . . . 

Stingray Pipeline Company (34271) has been changed to Stingray Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (200104). This change created a new Global Counterparty number so it prompted manual changes to the Pipeline Name & Pipeline Counterparty data within Global Facilities. It also prompted the need to move (via assignment within Global Contracts) all service related agreements from the old GCP record to the new GCP record. I left both names on the Global Record, BUT due to system controls can only have 1 listed with the role of "Pipeline". This role was assigned to the "new" name & the old name (which is now a suspended GCP record) was made "Alternate Payee". This was a "guess" role - - - - and I have no idea of how the service side is impacted or at what level it validates the Global record attached to the deal. All contract services are the same on each record, but the role of "Pipeline" now resides with the new GCP.

Can you either let all those who need to know - - - know & let me know who/how should I share information like this in the future. You got a Transportation Greenie (just 'learned' how to change pipeline names today) over here.

Thanks so much!!
Cyndie

OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

I did a buy/sale with EES where EES will give me TCO pool gas and I will give EES TCO pool or CGLF Leach gas.  The volume is 14,288 per day.

The purchase deal is 1068442, at CGAS IF.  This deal will not change.

The sale deal is #1068455, at CGAS IF - .05.  I have 2 meters on this deal, Kimat, let me know if that will be a problem booking the deal in tagg.

Robert, please chat with Rhonda on which contract to use.  We need to use the same Gulf contract all month long.  It would probably be easier for Rhonda if we use the same contract we used this month.

ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.  In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms).  Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.  Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691.  This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer.  The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00.  Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice.

Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket?  According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation.

Neither of these companies have paid us for December 2001 gas.  MidAmerica is probably holding payment for forward value, I don't know about Cornerstone.  Both had invoices sent to them for December sales.  Attached is Cornerstone's SAP balance.  Call me if you need any further information.

Have we flowed any IT transport on the East Desk pipelines for the month of January?  I think the answer is no but I wanted to double check?  If we did, then I need to know the pipeline, contract number and probably the volume.

Thanks.

I'm telling you life just can't get any better!!!!  We spent our first night together Friday night.  Of course we both have colds / allergies real bad so it was a sniffly experience.  It will take some getting used to thats for sure.  She was trying to set up the kitchen yesterday, bless her pregnant heart.

Nothing so far.  Joe Parks is checking with Bridgeline to see if we can buy gas from them.  It was late in the day before PanCanadian called.  I don't think PanCanadian will work because they do not have the flexibility to sell different daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

I hope we can work out a deal with Bridgeline.  Joe or I will be calling them first thing this morning.  

Yesterday afternoon Tallahassee indicated that they may not need the swing gas for the weekend.

Update:  ENA was buying daily swing gas from Sequent on Florida to supply the City of Tallahassee deal.  Sequent says this deal is an administrative burden and has elected not to supply any more gas to ENA after 2/1/2002.  Scott Goodell called Aaron Bohall with PanCanadian to see if they would become our new swing supplier.  Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions, 
	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper
	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning
	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.

This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.

HEY GIRL.  It's so good to hear from you.  Let's see,

I'm still here.  I work on the estate team which means I work on the old stuff until they tell us to leave.  My buddy Goodell is will be working for NewCo (The New Company - is this original or what).  They should find out something in the next couple of days I think.  Other than that its just hand around and see what happens.

So did you make good grades?  What's that report card looking like.  How's the hubby?  You still in love or what?

Just to give all some background.

We would like to understand the business plan for ENA, so that we can plan staffing, etc.  For example, in Retail, the business plan is to sale the books of business by May 31.  That allows us to make plans for each functional area to determine staffing gaps, etc.

We are looking for the same on Wholesale.

Chris - Can you help us with that?  If not, we will need to reschedule the meeting.

Let me know.

Because you have a discount before and after makes little difference - some
people call some days and not the next.  Kathy has called on Saturday and
Sunday for intraday rates.

I will go back and make corrections for you on the 14th.  How much volume?

I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my
system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it
AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days
after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have
forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry
about it.

   Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes
   on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we
   would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in my
   notes.

Actually, I need all of them because I can't tell what these items are for.  I will highlight the items that I think need to go out and put this report on your desk, can't be that many of them.  But I would still need the invoices to see what these items are for.

I have the gas Sales Invoice List Report that you just gave Phil, I think.  Would it be possible to format this with the deal numbers, or give me the invoices so I can see the deal numbers?

Thanks

Max, would you call Tiffanie Wheeler at Reliant to discuss the volume discrepancy on 2/27/02.  Her number is 713-207-6790.  I believe she said that if we provide them with pipeline support from Tallahassee, they will adjust our bill.  

Thanks.

Keep me posted.

Subject:	City of Tallahassee Adjustments for February 2002

Chris,

Pam at the City of Tallahassee sent me her volume reports for February 2002.
There are two adjustments that will be made to their invoice.

The base volume will be increased from 100,000 dth to 104,793 dth.
This will increase our supply with Dominion which I believe you have been informed
by Dominion as well.
The Swing gas for 2/27/02 will be reduced by 450 to 1,550 due to an operational scheduling cut
from the Reliant pool.  The City of Tallahassee has already deducted this from their payment on
the original invoice.  In summary, I will be preparing an additional invoice to the City of Tallahassee
in the amount of $14,570.72.  I will let you know when payment is received on this adjustment.

Don't forget my State of Florida adjustments!

Thanks,
Max

Do you want to work with Wade Price on the Appalachian suppliers on CGAS?  I think we are still getting gas because contracts have not been terminated or something like that.  It will probably be tedious but it doesn't matter to me.  Just let me know.

I, of course MUST have my lunch hour.  But after that is over, say 1:00
or so, lets get together.  Shemin, you set the time.  Wade, bring some
of those letters you are talking about down below.

Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.
Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd?? and terminate the pools without
Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.  You and Patricia can
decide if you want to come.

Thanks

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

Subject:	Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 
	1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
	2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell him.  This was an ENA deal.

If is was an ENA deal, the Dec. 3 is correct post-petition date.

I don't have anything on my list from TDC.  Won't hurt to call them anyway.

Subject:	FW: Letter re Unpaid Invoice for Post petition Deliveries

Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would "file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  

Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at Doyle on Transco.  I have devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.  Poke all the holes in it you want.

Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy

The higher of

Hey team!!  I'm back.

And while I was gone it looks like our cash balance with Reliant is $228,419.05, which is due to ENA selling Reliant the gas back on Trunkline from the 14th through the 20th.

Jim, I've updated my schedule for the gas flows on Florida.  Tallahassee sent me a schedule of what they show.  I'l like to compare that to what you have.

Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:

Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:

Germany, Chris says:

Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
i have to nom every day, even on weekends
Germany, Chris says:
now that sucks
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
tell me about it!
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
how's things with you?
Germany, Chris says:
doing well, last week i was bored with nothing to do, this week its like a tidal wave.  BAM.
Germany, Chris says:
home life is ok, baby is due may 7th and i get 5 days off to go fishing
Germany, Chris says:
Wooohoooo
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
you better not go fishing!
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
you'll be in the doghouse big time!
Germany, Chris says:
you mite be rite about that.
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
are you still involved in a church?
Germany, Chris says:
she's going to try and breast feed so i don't have to do anything
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
alexa & i just joined a baptist church and were baptised sun night
Germany, Chris says:
i'm going to st luke methodist on Westheimer and edloe these days
Germany, Chris says:
Cool.
Germany, Chris says:
i like baptist
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
jeff moved out sun and he filed for a divorce a couple of weeks ago
Germany, Chris says:
oh no, i'm sorry
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
we're going to MIM's 
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
i love and it and so does lexi
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
it's ok, a big burden has been lifted off of me and lexi
Germany, Chris says:
are you doing ok?
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
yes
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
he was very controlling and demanding
Germany, Chris says:
most of us guys are
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
and he didn't like alexa
Germany, Chris says:
I'm sorry.
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
did you ever get married?
Germany, Chris says:
nope, i gave her a ring but we are going to wait and see how things work out after the baby comes.  statistics show that that method doesn't lead to sucessful marriages very often
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
that's probably a good idea....you can probably relate to why i didn't marry brian now right!?
Germany, Chris says:
but we will see.
Germany, Chris says:
yeah but its a litte different.  i still think its pretty much my fault - what you and i went through and what Ingrid and I are going through.  In you situation i could see where brian was a major problem
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
i knew i didn't love him and i knew that that would not make a loving envirnoment to raise a child.
Germany, Chris says:
yep, that's what we are gong thru.
Germany, Chris says:
so are you going to stay way up North?
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
well, just know that if you ever need someone to talk to just let me know.
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
i'm staying there for now, going to hang out and see what happens here, then come 2/03, i can start looking for a job & not limited to just looking in houston any more
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
don't really want to go anywhere else right now but who know's what life will bring!
Germany, Chris says:
yep, may be time to consider richmond. VA
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
it snows there!!!  i don't think i could handle that (or i don't want to have to handle it!)
Germany, Chris says:
that's true - guess you've had your fill of snow.
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
i just can't handle the cold after being down here so long!
Germany, Chris says:
hey, maybe you could go to FPL in florida?  close to disney and beaches
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
with my retention (assuming we get the $$$!) i might pay off bills and then get a job as a greeter at the wal-mart in conroe!
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
are you in the retention pool?
Germany, Chris says:
Wooohooo, you must have a good retention.
Germany, Chris says:
i'm in the lipp pool, i think that's what they call it.
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
do you think we'll see the $$$?
Germany, Chris says:
You will for sure, don't know about mine though.
Germany, Chris says:
mine gets real nice if we collect $3Bill, don't know if we are going to collect that.
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
the lipp pool sounds a whole lot more 'vague'
Germany, Chris says:
yeah, i'm off to lunch chat with you later
Driscoll-Ernest, Marde L. says:
chow
Germany, Chris says:
chow - thats funny, i went to lunch with jay blaine, he's going to work contract for el paso starting monday

Ask Marvin or whoever looks at Tenn if they are interested in any Iroq / Tenn capacity.  The capacity goes from Tcpl/Iroq - Wadd to Iroq/Tenn - Wright, then from Iroq/Tenn - Wright to Mendon and Boston Gas citygate.

Even if we get bought out, the trading arm will still be going strong.  Gas and Power are the only things that ever made us money.  And you better still be there if I'm coming all the way back to see you!!

Just thought I'd let you know that I've accepted a new position within EnronOnline and I'll be moving back to Houston in early December.  Should be fun!  I'm looking forward to seeing you all soon and getting back into the swing of things.  

Hope all is well-

I've heard that there may be some job opportunities with Transwestern Pipeline.  They recently had an employee leave their marketing department.  I would like to talk to Kevin Hyatt and at least let him know that I may be interested in any future opportunities.  Would that be ok with you?

I'm not sure if it should be terminated but to my knowledge we are not serving this deal so it probably should be terminated.  I'm going to a "terminated contracts" meeting this morning so maybe I will find out more about how this works.  I also don't see any volumes on this deal for March.

We have two firm transportation agreements on Tennessee Pipeline.  The long term Boston Gas capacity release and a short term contract which expires on 1/31/2002.  The monthly demand charge on the short term capacity is $15,200.00.

Do we need to reject the short term capacity before it expires?  To my knowledge, we did not flow any gas on this contract for December or January.

A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with
two
buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing. The game
warden
asked the man, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?"

The man replied to the game warden, "No, sir. These are my pet fish."

"Pet fish?!" the warden asked.

"Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let
them
swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their
buckets,
and I take em home."

"That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"

The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here,
I'll
show you. It really works."

"O.K. I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious, now.

The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.

After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said,
"Well?"

"Well, What?" the man responded.

"When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted.

"Call who back?" The man asked.

"The fish." replied the warden.

"What fish?" The man asked.

I asked Kay Mann about that and she said that if we want the gas for April then we should continue with "business as normal" which means we pay for the whole month since that is what we've been doing.  She felt that paying for the whole month was better than paying for just 5 days worth of gas.
 
Ed, I gave this info to Doug before he went to the cash meeting.  This was just in case you had the same question.

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate.

I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?

Thanks

Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.

Questions that need to be answered, 
	** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?

	

The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.  In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.

I'm out but Kathy is probably going to be the chief on this anyway and I would just be her backup.  So you guys could probably meet without me.

FYI, I'm out all day Friday too.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 
	1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to
	2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Robin Barbe will talk to Jim Taylor at Reliant on Monday.  Jim Taylor's number is 713-207-1482.  We should have enough money at Reliant to cover purchases through Friday of next week.

Robin, Christina will let you know if Tallahassee calls on the gas.

I found a mistake in my capacity worksheet.

The term on the Boston Gas capacity, contract 125008, 35,465 MDQ, is 12/1/1998 - 3/31/2007.  I think have the ending date as 2008.

Joe Van Zandt with Dominion Field Services wants to know if we are going to nominate his gas for the first.  Their are 3 fixed price deals and 1 Index + $.10 deal.  I can't find the deals in the system.  What should I tell him legally besides NO?

Why don't you get a hamster or something like that.   You know my woman has
a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV.

I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so
pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the
next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to
visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some
museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor.

Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so
they say.

Words Women Use...

FINE ~ This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we
are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to describe how a
woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.

FIVE MINUTES ~ This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes
that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so
I
feel that it's an even trade.

NOTHING ~ If you ask her what is wrong and she says NOTHING, this means
something and you should be on your toes. NOTHING is usually used to
describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside
down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last
FIVE MINUTES and end with the word FINE.

GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows) ~ This is a dare. One that will result in a
woman getting upset over NOTHING and will end with the word FINE.
GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows) ~ This means "I give up" or "do what you want
because I don't care." You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead" in just a
few minutes, followed by NOTHING and FINE and she will talk to you in about
FIVE MINUTES when she cools off.

LOUD SIGH ~ This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal
statement very misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are
an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing
here and arguing with you over NOTHING.

SOFT SIGH ~ Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one
of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your
best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.

THAT'S OKAY ~ This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can
say to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard
before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you! have done.
"That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction
with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point in the near future when she
has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.

PLEASE DO ~ This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you
the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing
whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the
truth,
so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay."

THANKS ~ A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say "you're welcome."

THANKS A LOT ~ This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will say,
"Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you
have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."
Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as she will only
tell you "Nothing."

Please send this out to ! ALL men that you know just to warn them about
future
arguments they can avoid if remembering all the terminology.

And send to all your women friends to get a good laugh!

I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.

Thanks to each of you who agreed to sponsor my MS150 bike ride.  Can you please complete the following spreadsheet and return it to me?

 << File: MS150 Pledge Sheet.xls >> 

Just a few things you should be aware of:

1.  I prefer checks written to "National MS Society"  

2.  Please send checks to me (via post or interoffice mail) at: 
     work - 1400 Smith Street, ECS 04443, Houston, TX, 77002 or
     home - 3400 Timmons Lane #66, Houston, TX, 77027
     Or call me at 35966 and we can arrange something.

3.  The purpose of completing the pledge sheet is so that MS can send each of you a receipt for your records.

My riding continues....the wet roads made for an interesting ride on Sunday!!  Again, I thank each of you for your contribution.

The total amount we invoiced them for is $1,701,160.65.  I have a call into my contact there for information on what they didn't pay.  When I talked with her last week she did not indicate a short payment on the invoiced amount.  I will fax you the invoices.  

Also, I check in Unify this morning and nothing has come across for that 155,000 MMBtus.  So it is still not invoiced.

The $1,272,099 payment received from MCV was a lot less than I thought it would be.  I know that we had not yet invoiced them for 155,000 MMs on Panhandle, but the revenue associated with this was only $381,300.  My estimated total payment was for $2,038,374. 

What did we actually invoice them for in total?  If you could fax me the invoices to 646-3037.

Thanks.

With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people.  As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business.  Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer.  Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.  For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.  For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.  At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go. 

No one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice.  Please try to hold your head up, we have built a great company of talented, motivated, creative, and dedicated people.   Hold on to your integrity, respect yourself and each other, and remember what a team we have had.

Subject: How to Explain Enron to Your Children

A variation of a folkloric explanation of economic systems

FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.

FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take
care of them, and sells you the milk.

COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbors help take care of them and you
share the milk.

TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes both and denies
they ever existed and drafts you into the army. Milk is banned.

CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd
multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.

ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your
publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your
brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an
associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax
exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred
via
an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option
on one more.

P.S. When the sham is finally uncovered, you and the other executives
siphon
off all the companies assets, freeze the assets of the peons working on the
farm, and then tell them that there is no use crying over spilled milk.

Chris,

The plant was faxing this to Enron for them to determine gas scheduling. Since I have become more involved, I don't think the plant needs to fax this over to you/Justin/Kevin any longer.

If you agree, I will inform the plant.

Mr. Cooper,

First, I would like to thank you for all that you have done so far while here at Enron.  Although it has been difficult to continually hear one bad news story after another, it has been refreshing to finally learn the truth and be given the opportunity to make judgments and decisions based upon reality rather than some pipe dream that was being offered.  I truly feel that with your leadership, Enron is heading in the right direction and is slowly making progress in building back credibility.  

Second, as an employee in the LIP pool, I do however, have a couple of questions.  It has now been over three weeks since we received an update from Robert Jones regarding reaching the first $500,000,000 milestone.  In that update it was mentioned that there were some administrative issues that needed to be addressed with regards to the first distribution.  Are we any closer to resolving those issues and do we have an estimated time for that first distribution?  Second, do we have any idea today of how much money has overall been brought in to the estate that is to be used in determining the funding of the LIP pool?

Thank you so much for your time.

Kathy Kelly

P.S. We are greatly appreciative and happy about the reinstatement of the 401K matching.  Thanks again!

POINTY HEAD!!!!!!     I KNEW IT!  Poor little fella.

I like the apartment but the walk to the parking garage is terrible.  I don't think Immer is going to like it very well either when she's lugging the baby around.  Talk about space, I GOT IT!  For now anyway.  Yeah, I've emptied my car of certain items because I didn't want to carry them around.  Hey we need to discuss how to divy those up.  I've always wanted them even though I don't use them.  Dad gave me the single shot 12, but there is still the little one, the double (the prize possesion) and the new one that you wanted to use.

The apartment is still pretty empty.  I didn't want to empty my boxes until we got Immer's stuff in there.  I don't think she has that much either, living room furniture, bed, 2 bedroom night stands, armwour, kitchen talble, 1 stupid cat.....

new apartment.   You about got it all set up.   Nice apartment.   I like

To:  Enron Employees Worldwide
From:  Stephen Cooper
Date:  Thursday, May 2, 2002

As I mentioned at the employee meeting in April, this Friday, May 3, we will present to the Creditors' Committee a plan to separate our core energy assets from the estate and the issues surrounding our bankruptcy through a process called a "363 Sale."  These assets are viable businesses that represent Enron's roots.  If we are able to move quickly, we believe this 363 Sale process will allow us to maximize the value of these assets.

We intended to rollout our plan to employees early next week following the presentation to the Creditors' Committee.  However, the Wall Street Journal got a relatively final draft of our plan and were prepared to run a story today.  To ensure accuracy, we decided to work with the Journal on their story and I participated in an interview late yesterday afternoon.

I certainly regret that you have to learn about our plans from the media rather than directly from me or other members of the management team.  Yet until we present to the Creditors' Committee, we are still not at liberty to share the full details of the plan with employees.  We look forward to proceeding with our rollout early next week.  In the meantime, we've attached below the article from the Wall Street Journal.


Enron Plans Return to Its Roots --- Draft Proposal to Creditors Envisions a Smaller Firm Focused on Hard Assets
By Rebecca Smith and Mitchell Pacelle
The Wall Street Journal

	Enron Corp. plans to reorganize as a small company under a new name, according to a draft copy of the firm's plans -- returning to its roots of a decade ago, before the aggressive strategy that led to its spectacular expansion and then collapse. 
	Under plans scheduled to be presented to creditors Friday, Enron would carve out a small integrated energy company with assets of about $10 billion in North and South America. The new entity would likely take a new name in order to escape the taint of Enron's fall and the baggage of numerous investigations into its finances.
	It would then be put on the block in bankruptcy court, quickly giving Enron's creditors the choice to retain a stake in the new company -- or sell it off, whole or in parts, if more attractive bids emerge. 
	Enron lost the confidence of creditors and investors as revelations emerged last fall that the Houston-based company had hid debt and pumped up profit through a series of off-balance-sheet ventures that in some cases enriched a handful of senior executives. After failing to merge with rival Dynegy Corp., the company sought bankruptcy-court protection in December, the largest such filing in U.S. history. 
	The new plan calls for a small operating company -- for now dubbed "OpCO Energy Co." -- to own power plants, electric utilities, natural-gas pipelines and liquefied-natural-gas facilities, but little else. The biggest properties would be the Portland General Electric utility in Oregon; Elektro, a Sao Paulo-based Brazilian utility and about 15,000 miles of pipeline assets on both continents -- less than half the amount of pipes that Enron once possessed. 
	The plan would essentially make the Enron successor little different from other U.S. energy companies that provide electricity and natural gas, giving it few advantages over competitors. It would also make the new company more reliant than ever on volatile South American operations at a time when its U.S. rivals are scaling back their commitments in the region. 
	Nevertheless, Enron's new management team, headed since January by restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper, hopes that the creation of a new company will protect the assets it needs from a long bankruptcy-reorganization process that could hurt their value. Under the company's plan, all of Enron's other assets would be liquidated in that process. The number of employees would drop steeply -- from about 23,000 today (already down from a peak of 31,000 before the bankruptcy) to around 12,000. 
	"In my view, we're going to be in bankruptcy for a number of years, because of the difficulty we're going to have resolving all of the claims," Mr. Cooper said in an interview yesterday afternoon, after Enron's board had met to go over the plan. 
	A spinoff, he said, also could protect the new business from problems stemming from the bankruptcy such as customers wary of entering into new contracts and a welter of litigation and competing claims. Customers who otherwise might shun Enron could embrace the new company, Mr. Cooper predicted: "Once we're out from under, what they will see is a company with great assets and great cash flow that can stand on its own two legs." 
	Enron's creditors wield enormous influence over how the bankruptcy reorganization will unfold. Mr. Cooper and his advisers will have to convince these unsecured creditors -- who have asserted billions of dollars in claims -- that they stand to recover more of their money by turning Enron's core assets into a new company than selling them off in a fire sale. Because Enron now owes a fiduciary obligation to them, these creditors have the power to press the company to alter the plan considerably, or to proceed directly to a liquidation. 
	"The [creditors'] committee has a bunch of bright, reasonable businesspeople on it," said Mr. Cooper. "Their goal, to maximize value, is consistent with ours. I'm confident that we will be able to make a case for value maximization by adopting this approach." 
	Luc Despins, a lawyer for the creditors' committee, said he hadn't yet seen the plan and couldn't comment. 
	Protracted negotiations are likely to follow the Friday meeting. If and when Enron reaches an accord with creditors, Enron will file the plan with the bankruptcy court, which must then approve it. 
	The proposed reorganization would sweep away a decade of rapid growth, returning the company to its size in 1992, when former Chairman Kenneth Lay and then-President Richard Kinder were running the company. Four years later, Mr. Kinder left Enron and was replaced by Jeffrey Skilling, under whose leadership the company began to disparage hard assets and emphasize the energy-trading business that eventually turned Enron into a far larger concern. 
	Whether the new company can escape the taint of Enron is far from certain. "The success of OpCo as a going concern will depend on its ability to separate reputationally from Enron," the draft business plan says. In addition to winning support from creditors, Enron must disentangle itself from many complicated financial arrangements and an existing agreement to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co., a deal which hasn't yet closed. 
	In recent months, new managers have devoted considerable energy to trying to understand Enron's complicated financial arrangements. They are also trying to unravel the contents of a plethora of "SPEs" or special-purpose entities. They were created, beginning in the mid-1990s, as a way to pump up profits, hide debt and raise money from outside investors. 
	The draft plan contains a list of assets Enron wishes to retain for the new company, some of which may be entangled in these special-purpose entities. For example, Centragas, a pipeline company in Colombia, is a proposed asset of the new company. But separate, internal spreadsheets reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that controlling interest of that pipeline already had been pledged to two investment vehicles, Rawhide LP and Whitewing LP. They, in turn, may have passed along interests to other Enron entities, Tombstone Assets LLC and Ponderosa Assets LP. 
	The company said it is trying to "unwind" many of the investment vehicles to gain clear title to the assets for the new company, but it cautioned that "the unwind and resolution of these structures may affect the financial results presented" for the new company. 
	If the new company is created as outlined, its pro forma net income -- based on past performance of the units it hopes to retain -- is projected to be $243 million this year, $352 million next year, $450 million in 2004 and $503 million by 2005. That is based on assets of $10.1 billion currently, rising to $11 billion by 2003. 
	That's a far cry from what Enron claimed at its peak. In 2000, the last year that full financial records were posted by the company, Enron said its net income was $979 million on $100.8 billion in revenue. Those numbers -- as well as financial statements in the previous three years -- were eventually retracted as Enron came under increasing scrutiny from investors and regulators. 
	The plan said the company wants to keep enough assets to form the basis of a new company because the market is "already overloaded with properties for sale" and prices aren't very good. Enron's collapse is partly to blame for that market glut, because credit standards have been tightening, forcing many energy firms to shed assets and pare debt.

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

Thanks for writing buddy.  Things are going very well on the home front.  Things began to improve after you and I had our little chat before Christmas and they have been improving ever since.  I really do appreciate it.
 
How's work at Enron?  Good question.  I started taking my vacation on the 27th.  I'm scheduled to be out until the 14th to use up all of my 2001 vacation.  I honestly believe some of us will be let go this week or next week.  But then its anybodys guess these days too.  I do check my emails from home and thats when I got your message.  There isn't anything to do at work right now.  I guess we should hear something this week.
 
How are things going with you?

Chris:

The offer is now on our Iroquois OnLine system and has an offer number of 50153.  The only thing I've added is Liz Dennehy's email address which I have as ldenehy@keyspanenergy.com.

Also the offer term end date is 4/1/2002 at 09:00.  If I left it at your 3/31/2002 09:00 then they wouldn't be able to nominate it on the very last day of the month.  Please let me know if that is ok.  Thanks.

Ivy

Hey!!!!!    Is the wedding still on for Sunday?

		IF YES, then, are we invited or do you want to keep it small?

			IF NO, then, hey I understand - I'm not sure what we are going to do either.  She doesn't like the Vega idea.

As of 2:00 P.M., Steve has not heard from Col Gas.

I will be taking my vacation through Monday, Jan 14th.  I have a sneaky feeling that I may be let go before then anyway.  I will be checking my voicemail everyday and my emails every other day.  Also, I don't plan on being out of town for more than a day over the next 2 weeks.  I may leave town a few days during the week of Jan 7th.

This doesn't have everything on it AND i thought about just doing something more like a summary thingy with pretty much the same info on it.  I want you to take a look and tell me what you think.  I actually think a summary thingy, sorta like the info we used to have on the grease boards for bid week, would be easier to look at.  Give me your thoughts.

I'm estimating a $50,000 prepay to Reliant this Thursday.  Cash is up $.20 from Friday.  I may need to make the prepay on Wed again.  I'll have a better idea after 9:00 AM tomorrow.

                              PL- RESTRICTION

The work schedule for the pigging of the PL-1 system that was originally
scheduled for Monday, June 10, 2002, has been changed to Wednesday June 12,
2002.  This notice replaces the previous notice posted on Tuesday June 4th.
The implementation of this restriction on Wednesday means that there will
be no interruptible transportation capacity or non-PL1 transportation
capacity available along the PL-1 system.  This restriction will also
require that all deliveries at that time on the PL-1 system be made to
their primary delivery point.  All interruptible and secondary deliveries
along the PL-1 system will be reduced to zero effective for the gas day of
June 12, 2002, at 10:00 ECT (9:00 CCT).  Please give me a call if you have
any questions.

Priscilla won't talk to me but this is what I think she billed Mid American

310,000 dth x $2.47 per dth = $765,700.00

Goods and Services Tax  $765,700.00 x 7% = $53,599.00

Total Bill = $765,700.00 + $53,599.00 = $819,299.00

Priscilla, do we know who at Enron will pay the Goods and Services Tax?

Congratulations on the good news.  Sorry to hear about the bad news.  There seem to be lots of scheduling jobs around here but I don't know if you want to do that.  Bob Superty is the best person to chat with their.  Also, you might chat with AEP.  They just bought some Houston assets and they might be keeping those assets in Houston.

Hello Chris!

I was writing to give you some good news and bad news.

Good news:  I got engaged last weekend.  I am very excited!  Todd is a very wonderful person.  This is the person I met on MM last year who lives in Columbus.

Bad news:  I am getting laid off.  I transferred to Columbus with Clinton.  They are laying off half their staff.

I am not real fond of Columbus and hope to move back to Houston one day.  Hopefully we can work together again one day.

Hope all is well with you!

Take care!

Susan

We (EES) have been getting December production payments ready -- what are your thoughts on actually paying the post-petition pieces?   Besides Dominion, we have producers off of Gatherco, Columbia Natural Resources,  Columbia Gas Transmission, Peoples Natural Gas, and East Ohio Gas.    Are these on your list to review some day like you are doing Dominion?     A few producers have called wanting to know when to expect payment and I just need to know whether to forge ahead to get caught up in getting their payments in the system, or to wait in case we have the producers taken out of our pools on all these pipes/ldc's.   It is a ton of work, and if it doesn't need to happen, all the better, but if it does need to happen, I need to be working on it now.    
 
Also, only one company listed above could provide daily actuals so the others are just being split by 31 days.    I figured if the producer disputed his split (if paid), he could provide the back-up to make it more accurate.  
 
Any comments will be helpful.  Thanks.

Same as before.  We should have another supplier set up by the end of the day.  The calculation for the prepay is 2000 dth x $.1221 per dth = $244.20 for gas flow on 2/5/02 on Tenn contract 2891.

I've attached the prepayment request.  The physical address for the bank is

	Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
	C/O Bank Of America
	File  #96264
	840 S. Canal Street, 6th Floor
	Chicago, IL  60693

The address of the company we are doing business is 

	Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
	Nine Greenway Plaza
	Houston, TX  77046

The person I negotiated the deal with is Andy Armstrong, his number is 832-676-5120.
The person at El Paso Corporate Credit (Tennessee is a sub of El Paso) is Julie Baker, her number is 713-420-7446.


Eric,  Julie at El Paso said the only reason she is requiring a prepay for this small an amount is because her records show that ENA has not paid any monies for anything on the El Paso pipelines, including Tennessee, Sonat, ANR, or El Paso Pipeline.  I know that we should have at least paid for the Bear Creek storage on Tennessee.

I want to cancel the wire to Dominion Oklahoma that was set to go out today and I'm going to revise the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant.

The other wires to Reliant, the $701,760.00 and the $40,000.00, are good to go.

I will have this completed before lunch but I estimate that the $70,000.00 wire to Reliant will be revised to approximatly $995,000.00.
This net impact is an increase in cash outflows of $280,000.00 (cancel the $646,860 and increase the $70,0000to $995,000).

i agree with kay's suggested approach.

if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.

Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

There is nothing in Deal Volume Tracking regarding this deal.  I checked with Rita Wynne and she says it needs to be pathed.  As soon as that is done and I am notified, we can get the invoice out to MidAmerican.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 


Any comments or questions?

Subject:	MS150: Houston to Austin

Greetings,

I signed up for the MS150 bicycle ride from Houston to Austin on April 20-21.  One requirement is a donation of $300 to the National MS Society.  I hope to raise this minimum amount through contributions from colleagues, friends, and family; thus the purpose of this email.  With your help, you can help me raise funds to help find a cure for MS.  No donation is too small and I will provide you a receipt if necessary.

I've been training for two (2) months and it's been fun.  I've been biking off and on for a few years now but this is my first big two-day race.  And I look forward to the actual ride.

=================================================================================

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms may be mild such as numbness in the limbs or severe -- paralysis or loss of vision. 
Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are giving hope to those affected by the disease. 
The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is dedicated to ending the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.
=================================================================================

I'll be glad to share with you my progress and any (exaggerated) road bike stories.  Thanks.

I, of course MUST have my lunch hour.  But after that is over, say 1:00
or so, lets get together.  Shemin, you set the time.  Wade, bring some
of those letters you are talking about down below.

Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.
Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd?? and terminate the pools without
Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.  You and Patricia can
decide if you want to come.

Thanks

The end date on #21 (contract # 58654) is 4/30/2005.  The demand charge on #21 and #17 is $3.145 per month.  Also, ACA changed from $.0022 to $.0021 on ALL the CGLF transport.

Chris,

For path #17 and #21, could you tell me what the demand charges should be?  The two are different but are the same locations.  Also, we have #21 through mar-2005, structuring thinks it should be through Apr-2005.


Thanks

Looky at what I just opened in my email.  I had some stuff tucked away in a different directory and I'm going thru it now.  Does this still need to be addressed?

Hey Chris,

Does this amount look correct to you??  Do we actually owe New Power $5MM ?  they haven't mentioned it to me, but it's showing up as a balance due to them.  could you please verify ASAP?


Thanks!

Kathy said some Mobil traders created National Energy And Trade after Mobil let go of a bunch of people.  I guess you know that both Molly and Chris worked for Mobil.  By the way I did the math on Sabra.

$400 x 7 months = $2,800.00

$3,733.33 / 75% = $3,733.33

$3,733.33 / 5% = $74,666.67

All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

I am a proud papa!  She's so cute too!

What are you doing in CT?  I thougt you were in  CA?

Things are going ok for me.  Me and my "Woman" (we are not married - yet) are living in an apartment near Kirby and Westheimer.  I'm tired all the time anymore - not from staying up with the baby, that's woman's work.  I'm reading a Tom Clancy book and I can't put it down.

The mids are for last Friday and not for the month in question. We have not set physical curves for the summer as of yet. Let me know if you need anything else.

Hey.  I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week.  Left Wed afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too!  The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.  All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.  I could really get used to that sort of thing.

The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat.  I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my BOAT.

Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.  She stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.

Nothing else going on.  I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.

Later Gator.

You must have gone to the shark club on the other side of town... I was

Gave your resume to Bob Barron, boss over all gas traders. He's been tied up
in meetings all day... haven't touched base with him yet.

Kitties are good... they are going to loose their claws though... tired of

      I like to have all options open. Look for jobs and work on getting
      something
      lined up. If a company really wants you... they will wait for you.
   Lot's
      of
      times they will pay you the cash that you are waiting for at your
      current
      company... severance/bonus... etc.

      We are looking for folks.. you can send me your resume. They need
      traders,
      capacity folks, schedulers, and of course my errand boy too. Finally,
   we
      are
      starting to expand since bankruptcy is behind us!!!

      Sure.  I'll be there Monday morning.  Ingrid woudl probably like it

      What would you have me do?

      Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA.  Talk
      about a
      change in location.  I thought that was nice of him to offer though.

      So what do you think?  Wait and see if there is any severance, maybe
   a
      job,
      or activly look for a new job?

Hey there...

Can you please verify the following. Our files indicate that the two pal contracts for TCO are 39607 and 38079.
TCO is invoicing us on contracts 67401 and 70457. All these contracts show 310,000 MDQ.

Which ones are correct and current. I am assuming only 2 are or should be current. Please advise.

Thanks,

According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: 
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price  and the transport expense?

I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it  
AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry about it.

Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes
on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we
would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in my
notes.

The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M.  Also you need to know
that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant.  This means that
what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
you burn.  Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
during this time period.

I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.

Subject:	FW: Sonat Park & Loans and Sale to Sonat

These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing an additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.



Chris's notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

I do not know which, if any, of you guys is the right one to note this, but=
 I wanted to forward for the appropriate person's attention.  If not you, c=
ould you please advise me of the right Enron person.

That said, I recommend that the person within Enron responsible for this de=
al make sure that liability to Enron under the fuel  management deal be ful=
ly understood.  We are doing what we can to minimize penalties or costs, bu=
t we are quite limited in options due to the bankruptcy.  Please let me kno=

Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't=
 need. =20


Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=
g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=
pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=
es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =
said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =
was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=
liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =
June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=
M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=
nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=
hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =
flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =
also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=
n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=
ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =
I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=
ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=
he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =
but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =
plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =
they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=
.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=
e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =
to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=
mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=
act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=
to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=
tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=
ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=
rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=
 Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=
om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =
a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =
of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=
as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =
force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=
guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =
breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=
ion for transportation interruption. =20

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=
erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =
=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =
him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=
imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=
e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20

   =20
Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=
2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =
Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=
ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =
after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=
r the remainder or in a day. =20

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=
 to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =
rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=
ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=
pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=
hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=
 bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =
to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=
e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=
d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=
re had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=
nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =
 Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=
ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=
 the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=
hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=
 meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =
the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=
nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =
the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=
om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =
requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=
idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=
d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=
n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is "playing chicken" and are requesting ever=
ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =
them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=
ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=
posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=
 agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =
the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=
e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=
 =20

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=
 and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=
me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=
p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=
 at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =
HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=
t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=
er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=
es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.
=09
I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.

Attached is my worksheet showing our daily activity and prepayments.  I would like to send this worksheet to you 2 or 3 times a week.
Let me know if you agree with all the information.  We can also change the format.  I will be out of the office on Monday so Robin Barbe will be calling you.  Her number is 713-853-7177.

Also, we originally intended to wire more money to Reliant on Monday but we are trying to wire the money today due to the increase in prices.  I will keep you posted and I will update the schedule for any prepayments made today.

Chris,

I am faxing copies of Jan. 2002 and Feb. 2002 Sonat invoices to Maria.  I do see the balances on #1 and #2 on the Jan. 2002 statements.  It looks like we received 77,292 mmbtus back on contract PSNG2194 leaving a balance of 188,949 on deal #1222.  There was no activity for Jan. 2002 on contract PAL1001,deal 1424.  We were charged a total of $19,043.73 for the remaining volumes in storage ($.00305 per day).  Please let me know if there is anything else that I need to do.  

Thanks,

Rita x37694

Subject:	RE: Sonat Park & Loan

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Chris,

Be sure to call the electric co. to transfer your service.  It supposedly
takes them 3 business days to do a transfer, so I couldn't have mine
back-dated to when I moved.  I'm not sure how they'll work out the bills,
but I'm sure we'll get boo-foo'd somehow.

The number is (713) 207-7777.

I'm leaving soon to go to the Doc.

Rita FYI - I told Ed that I would go with Bridgeline's number because 
1.  it is more conservative
2.  the difference is small
3.  that some trader may not have put in a deal or volume management didn't path the deals correctly....anything is possible with the turnover we have had.

If you have reconciled the numbers and know where the difference is let me know.

Thanks

Stuart,
Chris recommends that we go with Bridgeline's number, as it is much more likely to be accurate at this point.  If Rita Wynne has time and it does not delay your efforts, you could have her attempt to reconcile the balance.

Ed,

The person that you mentioned this morning failed to make it to our meeting .  Not a big deal but, as a result, I want to catch you up with where things are.  

We established that:
(i) it is going to be very difficult to determine a fair market value for the put option;
(ii) Greg Sharp is going to speak with McConnell this morning about obtaining the necessary support for buying the option;
(iii) Greg is going to determine all amounts currently owed (and past due) from Bridgeline to ENA; 
(iv) we need you to help us confirm the amount of gas in storage (Hugh Connett suggested that their numbers show about 1.93 BCF); 
(v) I am going to circle up with PWC and Blackstone (after hearing back from Greg) to talk about the deal and get their reactions; and
(vi) I am going to speak with Bridgeline on a preliminary basis about some of the deal terms (in particular (a) the option price, (b) doing the gas sale earlier and escrowing the proceeds, (c) mitigation of damages and how that mitigation should affect the amounts (both pre and post-petition) that are owed by ENA to Bridgeline and (d) increasing the amount payable for the gas in storage (because this deal is distinguishable from the pad gas sale in that we will be paying for the transport to move it)).

Let's visit on this when you get a moment.  Also please help me with item (iv) above.  Finally, I need you to tell me if you are OK with how this thing is shaping up.

Stuart

Due to credit concerns, Carol and Bjorn would like to know all counter parties that we are currently buying or selling spot gas with.

Ex:  I've been buying gas from Reliant Energy Services, Inc. each month to serve one of my term markets.  According to Bjorn, the Credit Committee will no longer approve of my prepayments to Reliant for base load supply.

Melissa verified receipt of our $45,000.00 wire yesterday.  Thanks Melissa.

You should receive the following wires today.
$683,835.20 for baseload gas on Trunkline (6,800 dth x 31 days x $3.244)
$1,365,767.00 for baseload gas on Florida (13,000 dth x 31 days x $3.389)

Our current swing gas cash balance is $81,700.00 so we may not send another wire until next week.

Also, Robin Barbe will be my backup when I'm out.  Her number is 713-853-7177.

Thanks

I sold 3,253 dth per day of  Florida Zone 3 gas at $3.60 to Bob Crites (713-420-2499) at El Paso effective 4/3/02 - 4/30/02.  I'm leaving this deal out of Sitara because its an Enron Compressor Services deal, not ENA.

Kay, I need to send a GISB agreement as Enron Compressor Services to El Paso.  Would you work on that?

Mark, I'm not sure who at Enron to notify about this deal.  You and I can chat about that later.

I only asked for 2 bids for the April gas.  Reliant showed me a bid of $3.58 and El Paso shoed me a bid of $3.60.

I still don't have access to West (deal 1198936).  I'm almost positive I entered this deal and I thought I entered it as a Central Desk deal.  When I book my deals on Trunkline for April, should I use Central?  We will be serving the Midland Cogeneration deal #340362 for April.

I also didn't request access for ENA Upstream but Kathy Kelly should be able to take care of that.

Tennessee requires a pepayment or LC in the amount of $25,000.00 per SA pool.  For the Keyspan deal, that essentially means we would need $25,000.00 of credit for each point, 500L, 800L, and Zone 0 = $75,000.00 total.

These are my notes on flowing gas.  Tetco will be the problem pipeline.  I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it.  I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00.  I'm using the following formula

	MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price 

They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem.  It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.  I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.  If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.

Who knows what volumes are going to be?

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

	Luling City Market on Richmond - BBQ
	Cafe Express on West Gray - great burgers
	Berryhill Taco's - Westheimer at Kirby
	Ryans Steakhouse - poor man's steakhouse and buffet off 290 outside the loop.

I'll have to decide next week what I want to feed you.  Of course you have a say, a small one anyway.

Tommy, I see you didn't approve my access for AEP which is fine.  I only need access to all the Estate desks and I just asked Daniel to give me everything because I don't know where the deals are for the other desk.  I didn't know if the Central Desk deals are under Central Desk or one of their many other books.  I think I just need Central, East, West, and Texas.

But, maybe you can help.  My request for the Central Desk needs Darron Giron's approval and he's not in the People Finder.  So he's either at UBS or he left the company.  Do you know who I should be approving that now?

With a heavy hand I write this message to the Aquila Merchant Services people.  As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business.  Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer.  Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.  For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.  For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.  At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go. 

No one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice.  Please try to hold your head up, we have built a great company of talented, motivated, creative, and dedicated people.   Hold on to your integrity, respect yourself and each other, and remember what a team we have had.

Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

Subject: Termination / Release letters for Producers on Dominion Transmission



Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter. 

Several  gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool.  They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers.  Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them.  I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests.  Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships.  Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below.  I am sure more producers will call. 

Thanks  WRP 

The following producers have been calling requested such letters:

9:50 AM Per Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent.  Tammi spoke to Lisa Guthrie (205-325-3816) at Sonat to find out what flexibility Sequent would have taking out the parked gas.  Lisa said she didn't know if Enron could sell the gas.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Jon asked some lady to call me back and she didn't know either.  At first she did it the way you show it on your worksheet.  Then when I told her that normal demand charges ( a 1 year deal at max for example) are the same each month regardless of how many days there are in the month she got confused.  I guess we will find out when we get the invoice.

Supposedly, the same material is covered in either 2-day, 4-week, or 6-week
sessions.  Our options for classes are the weekend of Mar 23 for the 2-day
(goes from 9 to 3 Sat and another couple hours on Sun); Apr 16 - May 6 for
the 4-week (not so good cuz it ends awfully close to our due date); and Feb
20 - Mar 25 for the 6-week (this one meets 7-9 on Wed nites).

What are your thoughts?

FYI.  This is the formal response we received from Bridgeline yesterday.  In the event Bridgeline does not agree to purchase the gas, what delivery point on Bridgeline is best for us to use under FT if we were to bleed out the inventory over 30 days and what price could we get?

We appreciate your support on this.

Thanks.

Attached is a letter from Randy Curry faxed to me yesterday afternoon outlining the initial proposal made by Bridgeline in our meeting yesterday.  Bridgeline is not formally offering to purchase the gas, however, in a subsequent voice mail from Randy, such a purchase is not out of the question.

Additionally, ChevTex has formally requested through Jayne that the accounting information be provided for their review.  I agree with Mark Ellenberg's view that we should not provide this until we have agreement on the commercial deal.  Jayne/Stephen, I would like to hear from you on this.

We need to huddle today to discuss our response to Randy's letter and keep the momentum alive.  Given the LIP meetings this morning, can I suggest 3:00 this morning in ECN2829?

Before then, I may be calling around to get people's views on a response.

Thanks,

Chip

Words Women Use...

FINE ~ This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we
are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to describe how a
woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments.

FIVE MINUTES ~ This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes
that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so
I
feel that it's an even trade.

NOTHING ~ If you ask her what is wrong and she says NOTHING, this means
something and you should be on your toes. NOTHING is usually used to
describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside
down, and backwards. "Nothing" usually signifies an argument that will last
FIVE MINUTES and end with the word FINE.

GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows) ~ This is a dare. One that will result in a
woman getting upset over NOTHING and will end with the word FINE.
GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows) ~ This means "I give up" or "do what you want
because I don't care." You will get a raised eyebrow "Go ahead" in just a
few minutes, followed by NOTHING and FINE and she will talk to you in about
FIVE MINUTES when she cools off.

LOUD SIGH ~ This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal
statement very misunderstood by men. A "Loud Sigh" means she thinks you are
an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing
here and arguing with you over NOTHING.

SOFT SIGH ~ Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. "Soft Sighs" are one
of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your
best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content.

THAT'S OKAY ~ This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can
say to a man. "That's Okay" means that she wants to think long and hard
before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you! have done.
"That's Okay" is often used with the word "Fine" and used in conjunction
with a raised eyebrow "Go ahead." At some point in the near future when she
has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble.

PLEASE DO ~ This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you
the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing
whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the
truth,
so be careful and you shouldn't get a "That's Okay."

THANKS ~ A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say "you're welcome."

THANKS A LOT ~ This is much different from "Thanks." A woman will say,
"Thanks A Lot" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you
have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the "Loud Sigh."
Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the "Loud Sigh," as she will only
tell you "Nothing."

Please send this out to ! ALL men that you know just to warn them about
future
arguments they can avoid if remembering all the terminology.

And send to all your women friends to get a good laugh!

I just received a call from Joe Krajewski (617-723-5512 x4731) at Boston Gas.  He is a Resource Management Analyst at Boston Gas working for Liz Danehy.  According to Joe, ENA is still billing Boston Gas for part of the demand charges on the long term producer netback deal (that Ruth is so familiar with).  This is Iroquois and Tennessee capacity I am releasing back to Boston Gas each month at a 100% demand rate.

Joe asked me why we were doing this and I told him that ENA was probably not paying the capacity bills and Boston Gas was aware of that fact and knew Boston Gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway.  Sounds like Boston Gas may be getting double billed and Joe said they will probably not pay the invoice.

Hey, I don't think you should show any cash flow for the Enbridge storage until I talk to them this afternoon.  I'm writing an email to you and a few others about what I think we should forcast and I want to talk to them first.  But between you and me, I'm thinking we show about $600,000 or so.

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

Per my discussion with Dave Evans - MidAmerican agreed to pay ENA for this gas and will not net this deal with any other deal.  We also discussed doing this deal under a GISB agreement but if we have some other post-bankruptcy agreement that we can trade under then that's fine with me.  You and Stacy can decide if we need to put any of this information on the confirm.
 
Stacy also has some comments below pertaining to the GST tax that should may need to be included in the confirm.  I did not discuss the GST tax, I felt fortunate that someone would do business with me.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

Sign us up.  BUT, I may be WHO KNOWS WHERE sowing all my wild oats with half naked Brazilian women.  I don't have that many oats left anyway, it could just be an oat.  By the way, Suzanne made a Second Baptist comment to me yesterday when I was talking to Robert.  I can't remember exactly what she said but I sure do wish you wouldn't tell her anymore STUFF about us.  I finally figured out that her and Jim are very similar.  Information is power that they can share with others, even useless trivia information about friends.  I don't think either one of them mean any harm, they just can't keep their big mouths shut.

I'm off to another wild day of tariff review.  Call me when you can, it brightens my day and wakes me up!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Later Gator

Kathy, we have a deal on Trunkline where Midland can request up to an additional 1,700 per day and it could be just 1 day over the weekend too.  Reliant has storage that can flow into Trunkline Wla.  We don't have a pricing mechanism in place so its pretty much automatic and Reliant can bill us whatever they want.  If it ever happens on the weekend, Jim and I will discuss the pricing the following Monday.  Its only happened once in the last 2 months but YOU NEVER KNOW, especially if it happens on the weekend.

If I remember correctly, Midland would call Kevin and Kevin would call Reliant.  Are we sill set up that way?

The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).  I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price.

Ruth, you and I are chatting about this today I hope.

Kam, I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month.  I don't know if you need to be involved or not.

Hi Chris,

I realize that you are getting bugged from a few of us in Canada for the Boston Differential numbers.  I am in Accounting and I am in desperate need of the Boston Differential for August and September so that I can finish my invoicing for the month.  I really have to have these numbers by the end of the day today (latest).  Sorry for being a pest, but I am starting to panic!  Please send these numbers to me or Nicole Laporte, as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Kelly

Chris,
We just require August and September, we already have July.
Would it possible to get the differential number before Wednesday? Our Accounting group requires this number for invoicing and they are a few weeks late with their August invoice and require the differential immediately.
Please let me know,
Thanks,
Nicole

Sorry about the delay.  I'm starting to look at this again.  I know you need August and September.  Did you say you also need July?  

I don't know if Canada makes any money off this deal but my book is taking a beating.  Ruth Concannon and I are meeting Wednesday to discuss this deal.  There are some other things going on with this deal that she is aware of.  I should have your prices by them.

Subject:	Dominion gas supply Tallahassee deal on Florida

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

HEY WOMAN!!!!   What the heck are you doing?

I did make it back.  I actually came in most of last week.  I just get way to bored at home in my tiny little apartment.  I have this strong urge to go out and spend  money and that's just the wrong thing to do right now.

We don't really know much about the New Company right now.  I'm actually on the estate team anyway.  I sit on 5 with Ruth Concannon, Sylvia Pollen, Robin Barbe, and Kathy Kelly.  The rumor 2 weeks ago was that UBS was going to cut 25% of the jobs if they won.  I think Victor said that we should know alot more by tomorrow.  I think I know of a couple of people that have left; David Jones (black guy in origination - real nice guy too) starts working for TXU in Dallas today, Darren Farmer (Texas Desk)  is going to AEP.

I did take a look at the $139,000 home.  This house has been on the market for awhile.  The backyard sits next to some big building - that's a bad thing.  I have not had a chance to look at the other house - the sq footage seems really small though.  Based on what I've seen over the last 8 months, it would take something around $190's - $205's to make me happy and I'm not willing to spend that much right now.

Another thing that bothers me is the economy.  All I hear about are layoffs.  The only industry still booming is the energy industry and we keep streamlining.  That's what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a house.

Thanks for the info though.

On Nov 13th, I sold 2700 dth to Black Hills in Tenn Z6 for the 13th.  I bought the gas from Hodge on CNG.  I need to know where the gas is if it didn't get delivered to Tenn.  The deal ticket shows that I changed added the deal at 8:50 am.  The volumes must have been in Sitara because Sitara shows Joann changing the volume from 14085 to 11348 on the 14th?  Then it shows me changing the volume back on the 14th.

Lia, would you see if we even nominated the intraday on the 13th to Black Hills?

The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M.  Also you need to know
that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant.  This means that
what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
you burn.  Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
during this time period.

I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.

I think this will do for now.  I was sniffling the other evening when we went out for a little drinky and Meredith said you wanted to work out instead of seeing me.  I was so sad and heartbroken.  Baby's doing good.  Woman has not had any problems so far and she's starting to feel the baby move on a regular basis now.  I've never felt the little sucker move - maybe she's just getting fat.  What do you think?

We keep loosing people.  Christina is moving to the Estate Team power dispatch group.  Good for her.  That will make her in expendable.

how the heck are you?

Margaret, for some reason my cash request form has Susan Helton's name on it and she has to sigh the wire I think.  Why wouldn't that be you instead?

Subject: Manual Wire/Check Requests


Folks,
 
Starting Monday, 4/22/02, manual wire requests will have to go through the Cash Management Committee (CMC) the day before payment.  This means that the request forms and accompanying support documentation will have to be signed by the appropriate signatories of the business unit (BU), the BU CAO and the BU Head and delivered to myself (3-6337) at EBN 714a or Drew Kanellopoulos (3-9424) the day before the CMC meeting.  For example, if you need a wire sent on Wednesday, 4/24/02, you would need to deliver the request to us by the end of the day on Monday, 4/22/02 so the request could be reviewed at the 4/23/02 CMC meeting.  Check requests should be delivered three days in advance.
 
The only exceptions to this process will be items such as same day payment for prepay commodities.  
 
We appreciate you helping us relieve the incredible stress on the system to get payments more efficiently and please pass this on to anyone I have missed.
 
Regards,
Doug

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

Hello everyone,

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.  He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Please help this worthwhile cause if you can.

Thanks,

Vicki Versen

Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.

I WANT TO GO.  Do you want to come by Wednesday evening.  I'm almost positive we are going to leave early (around 2:00 or so probably).  You won't even get a chance to see my messy apartment because I am going to sleep over at Indrid's and kill (bond) with her cat.

One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.

He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.

With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!

Now, the Moral of the Story:
Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.  Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!

Remember the five simple rules to be happy:
1. Free your heart from hatred.
2. Free your mind from worries.
3. Live simply.
4. Give more.
5. Expect less.

P.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him.

Moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you.

Notice to all Dominion Transmission shippers:

In an effort to better accommodate the needs of our PL-1 customers we have
rescheduled the pigging work that was scheduled for Wednesday June 12,
2002, to Friday, June 14, 2002.  This notice replaces all other notices
that were posted on DTI's EBB with regard to this issue.  The
implementation of this restriction on Friday at 10:00 a.m. ECT (9:00 CCT),
means that there will be no interruptible transportation capacity or
non-PL1 transportation capacity available along the PL-1 system.  This
restriction will also require that all deliveries at that time on the PL-1
system be made to their primary delivery point.  All interruptible and
secondary deliveries along the PL-1 system will be reduced to zero
effective for the gas day of June 14, 2002, at 10:00 ECT (9:00 CCT).
Please give me a call if you have any questions.

According to Iroq the problem is on our side.  Please call me first think Monday morning at 3-4743.  Following is the address that I'm starting at.  I go to this address and click on "Customer Activities" and that's when I get the error message.  It should ask me for my ID and password.

I'm at ECS 04425 if you decide to come by my desk.  I'm out for the rest of the day.

Subject:	Steve's Happy Hour

Since I got such an overwhelming response from everyone (Clarissa is the ONLY one that responded to my email...) about happy hour tonight and based on the rumors that I am hearing that a few people had WAY too much to drink last night, we are moving Steve's birthday happy hour to next week.  He says anyday is fine with him so if anyone has any preferences of where to go or when, please let me know.
see ya!

She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out.  Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.

I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough.  Good luck.

What kind of kitty does Ingrid have??

Rob is fine... we had a little tiff and didn't talk for a week. He went to
the LDC forum in Boston. We made up over e-mail today... or at least
exchanged apologies. I'm not sure when I'll see him again. Gloria is
visiting me next weekend... girls night out. The following weekend Cindy is
visiting me. The weekend after that I'll be in Houston for TCO shipper
meeting. It has been two weeks since I've seen him. We have a great time
when we are together, it just hasn't been very often latetly.

I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so
pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the
next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to
visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some
museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor.

Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so

As I getting back up to speed on the last week in the Gas industry I see falling prices and widening spreads on Niagara to Leidy which explains why I only have 18,000 available on IT from Niagara to Leidy with another 10,000 available from Pendleton to Leidy.

40,000 dth for excess injections and 100,000 dth for excess withdrawals.

A heartwarming story of the advances of women in achieving equality throughout the world.  Barbara Walters did a story on gender roles in Kuwait several years before the Gulf War.  She noted then that women customarily walked about 10 feet behind their husbands.  She returned to Kuwait recently and observed that the men now walked several yards behind their wives.  Ms. Walters approached one of the women and said, "This is marvelous.  Can you tell the free world just what enabled women here to achieve this reversal of roles?"

"Land mines," said the Kuwaiti woman.

I can't find any of the reports that Kim Olinger used to run out of Unify.  BUT, Jeanne Wukasch was in Kim's group and she would know how to run them.  I believe they were called Service P&L reports.  The only thing we would use them for now are transport demand charges.

Hey team.  ENA should be wiring Reliant $25,000.00 today.

I will be out tomorrow and Christina Sanchez (713-345-7791) will be backing me up.

Christina, tomorrow morning, call Jim Taylor (713-207-1482) by 9:00 AM and let him know if we are taking the gas or not.  If Jim isn't there, ask for the person trading Florida.  Malory (don't know her last name or her number) has been backing Jim up this week.  Reliant has the option of giving us the gas in Z2 or Z3 at a Z2 GD price.  Jim will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend, even though it hasn't happened before.

Have a good weekend!

I don't have any letters that the producers have sent to Dominion, but I do have copies of  termination letters and release letters they sent to us.  I can fax you some samples - what is your fax number? 
 
At Dominion, I talked to Dan Baney, who knew only that they were requiring releases per their legal department.  
Dennis Bond is a more knowledgeable person at Dominion at 304-627-3566.
Their attorney handling this matter is Bill Savier at 304-627-3340.

Subject: Termination / Release letters for Producers on Dominion Transmission



Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter. 

Several  gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool.  They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers.  Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers.


I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them.  I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place.

Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests.  Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships.  Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process.

A list of producers is provided below.  I am sure more producers will call. 

Thanks  WRP 

The following producers have been calling requested such letters: 
                                                                        Master Log

I borrowed 19903 from Egan for today's gas day and I need to pay it back by Friday.  For tomorrow, I am going to over nominate Leach.  After the cuts, if any, I want to back off of Leach and take the gas to Egan to payback back part of my balance.


Here are the deal numbers and volumes.


Deal		Current Vol	After Cuts	Comment
1149149	21,000		10,000		Moves gas from CGLF Leach to TCO Leach.
1143923	31,000		20,000		Mainline to Leach Transport
1143924	49,798		38,469		Onshore to Mainline - volume may be off a little, just need to balance mainline
1161116	7,707		????		Onshore to Egan Hub transport and desk to desk.  Move the onshore balance to Egan Hub.


I may be out this afternoon.  I think we should wait until tomorrow morning to adjust these tickets, UNLESS KELLY, you feel comfortable about CGAS not allocating Leach.  


Thanks for your support.

DTI will not be charging for TTT service through June 01, they will probably not start to charge any time soon, however they still have the ability to charge.  My feeling is that they will find it difficult to charge after providing the service for free for some time.  If they do start to charge by nom is there a way we can provide that service?  I will think about that one.

Hi team.  I apologize for the short notice but I need to take off this afternoon.  I will have my cell phone.  The number is 713-557-5095.  Most of my time will be spent waiting around in the Dr.'s office just to have a 5 min chat, so feel free to call me if you need anything.

I also plan on taking Monday off.  Robin will be handling the physical activity.

I would bump up the cash payment to Reliant for next week.  I'm estimating $56,000.00.  I do expect it to come down some.

Chris,
I need you to lead the effort to work with/through legal to fully explore our alternatives and then recommend a solution to resolve.  PwC and Weil probably need to be informed of your efforts.  If you have any questions, please ask.

Subject:	RE: Dominion Producers

Listed below are ENA's pool balances as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.  From ENA's perspective, I would prefer to terminate the pools effective 11/30/01.  That would leave ENA with a negative pre-petition imbalance on Dominion and ENA would not have to pay the producers for December production or worry about selling a positive imbalance in an un-friendly market.  However, Dominion will probably not let ENA terminate the pools until 12/31/2001 due to the negative cumulative imbalance.

Questions that need to be answered, 
	** will ENA have to pay the producers for December (possibly January) production if Dominion will not let ENA terminate the pools any earlier?
	** how will Dominion handle the positive imbalance if the pool is terminated on 12/31/01 or later?

	

The operations contact at Dominion is Iris King (304-627-3213), she is one of the managers over the operations group.  In my opinion, we should terminate the pools as early as possible.

Hi Chris,
I am just checking to see whether you sent me your conclusions regarding
whether ENA should terminate the pooling agreement with Dominion. Do we
still need to speak with Iris? And, can we set up a meeting with Ed
McMichael so that we can make a decision and move forward? Please call
(5-3910) or email me.
Thanks,

I have called to have the server bounced.  It will take about 15-20 minutes.  Then you can set up the deals in Sitara.  

Let me know if you have any problems.

Reliant Energy.  I would like to talk to Reliat if you want to do something with them.  I currently have a cash balance of $228,000 with Reliant.  We are going to send them and invoice for $156,000 for sales ENA made to Reliant.  That will leave me with about $71,000 and maybe we can do something to work it off.


Cinergy will not trade with Enron.  Robin Barbe's contact told her they would not trade with us regardless.

Deal		Counter party					Sitara Contract
Comment
942720		California Energy Hub, SOCAL			96063621		
this is an exchange deal.  California Energy Hub is not listed on the Master Letter Log.  Socal is but there  are no contract numbers listed.  The hedge on this deal was killed in Sitara on 1/8/02.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $.10 x 310,000 dth per day, which may be incorrect.  Its possible that the volume should be 310,000 dth per MONTH.

773141		Central Illinois Light Company			96000389		
No changes made to Sitara ticket since 5/4/01.  Per Master Letter Log - ENA cancelled the financial agreement due to Central's failure to pay.  No reference is made to the physical deal.  Per Sitara - this deal has a min and max volume.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $.425 x 10,000 dth per day.

889014		Colorado Spring Utilities				96062701		
No changes made to Sitara ticket since 6/29/01.  Per Master Letter Log - only activity with EPMI is listed, no mention of any contracts with ENA.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $7,200.00 per month.

22109		Consolidated Edison Company of New York	96000908
Long term sale to ConEd on Tennessee pipeline.  Not listed on the Master Letter Log.  Per Sitara - the hedge in Sitara was killed on 11/26/01.  The March invoice is for demand charges of $101,339.35 which is a percentage of the Tenn Z1 and Z0 indexes.

1161432	Superior Natural Gas Company			96052897
Not listed on the Master Letter Log.  Per Sitara - hedge in Sitara was killed on 12/12/01.  This is a sale to Superior with a NYMX trigger, the trigger was entered in Sitara on 11/6/01 at 14:32 and the trigger price was $3.05.  The March invoice is for the difference between the trigger price of $3.05 and Nx1 for March $2.388 = $.662 x 10,000 dth per day x 31 days.

1201382	TXU Fuel Company				96096343
This deal probably should not be in Sitara.  Its related to sales made by the Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. to TXU.  This activity used to handled by the Texas Desk.  If Feb 2002, it was decided that all activity should flow through the partnership instead of ENA.  I took all prices on this deal to 0.

I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so
pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the
next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to
visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some
museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor.

Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so

Per my discussion with Sherry Glazebrook at Tennessee, she wasn't real specific since I don't have an EES ID on Tennessee but this is what I found out.

CONTRACTS

Balancing Agreement K# 31905 (OBAD)  This is a balancing agreement for Bethlehem on the 200 leg in Zone 5, probably meter #20816.  This balancing agreement should have been cashed out every month.  She wouldn't tell me the current balance.  ENA had a term sale to EES (sitara #1003036).  The volume was 1,200 dth per day in Tenn Zone 5 and the name of the point was Bethlehem Sales.  The term of the sale matches the term of the capacity release from Boston Gas.
Firm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38535 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38539 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company   All 3 capacity releases from NYSEG are non-recallable.  In my opinion, this capacity should be the property of the customers EES was serving behind the NYSEG city gate and the capacity should go with the customers.  But, I believe we need to address the LDC tariff issues along with the pipeline issues.
Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT)   
Supply Aggregation Servic e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)

Of all the items shown above, I am more concerned with the Balancing Agreement k#31905.  We need to know what has happened to the sales customers EES had at this point.  I believe it was just one customer.  How is this customer currently getting its gas?  If Enron is still the operator of the balancing agreement at this point, does it "appear" that Enron is still using this agreement?

Subject:	Tennessee Gas Pipeline Contracts --  EES 

Tennessee Gas Pipeline has made a global Enron bankruptcy filing.  We have checked the information that EES provided earlier to Maria and there was no retail contracts on Tennessee Gas Pipeline shown.  Tennessee shows the following six active contracts with Enron Energy Services, Inc.  Please provide some additional clarification including the following information so that Enron can decide how to best respond to the filing.

CONTRACTS

Balancing Agreement K# 31905 (OBAD)
Firm Gas Storage Service K# 38454 (FS-MA Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38535 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & Gas Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K# 38539 (FT-A Assign) -- Assignment from New York State Electric & GAs Company
Gas Transportation Agreement K#27848 (IT)
Supply Aggregation Servic [Germany, Chris]   e Agreement K# 80265 (SA)


INFORMATION REQUIRED

Is the contract active or how/when did EES dispose of it?
Did EES nominate under the agreements since November 30, 2001?  If so, provide nomination by day.
Does EES need to retain the contract?
How much pre-petition and post-petition claims are due to Tennessee?
Are there any contract imbalances remaining that need resolution?
For transport assignments, can contract be re-released back to NYSEG?
Can EES provide a copy of the contract, capacity posting and back-up information for the bankruptcy files?

As always, there is a short turnaround time to complete Enron's response to the filing.

Please respond by Monday, March 4th.

Thanks,

Ruth Concannon

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
	Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I asked her to call me back.

Chris, I am still trying to get these imbalance trades resolved.  John Bieltz is no longer with Amereda Hess but Cindy Wernecke has been working this issue.  She can be reached at (703) 317-2293.  Can you please get back to me as soon as possible as they would like to resolve.

Thanks
Laurie

I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we were not aware of.

Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

Yesterday David Drapper (sits a few rows over from us and works for EES) asked me what the status was with the Dominion producers.  I told him we were still waiting for Dominion to call us back.  He said that Sean Holmes told them to "just pay the producers".  I told David that I wouldn't do anything without knowing what Ruth and legal are doing.

Sounds like a little tendency to "split up".  Just like the old days.

If that is the case then converting 327,081gj's to mm's yields 310,012mm's, so you are probably correct, I can adjust it to reduce down the 12mm's.

I am starting to path it up right now, I have a question regarding the volume. The way I have interpreted these e-mails, we should be withdrawing a total of 310,000 from dawn storage, right now deal1199439 is set up to deliver 327,081. I can adjust the back end days to reduce our deliveries down to 310,000, just want to be sure this is our target #.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 
Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 
        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.
Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 
 
Any comments or questions?

I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.

Kathryn (EES Volume Management) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers  for EES.  Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department.  We may have to do that anyway.  I'm not sure what this report is called, I just know its on a 2 month lag.  I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB).  If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me.  If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.

Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this.  If the person that handled Dominion is gone, then I'll just go the "legal" route.

Thanks

Roses are red.

You're a pain in the ass,
But I s'pose I am, too.

So oft when we meet,
We fuss and we fight.
It becomes hard to see
That we share a love of great might.

But no matter the tears,
Or gut wrenching fears.
As we grow old,
We create a togetherness,
Lovely to behold.

Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00 from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001 (sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would "file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.  

Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?


Calculation of Post-Petition Payment using Dec 3 as Post-Petition day
Gas scheduled Dec 3-24, 26-31 = 28 days, volume = 3,000 dth per day
28 x 3,000 x $2.419 = $203,196.00

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

All I need to know is if ENA received the gas as stated, and if there are any extenuating circumstances which would keep us from paying.  Otherwise I believe we need to make payments in accordance with the terms of the deal.  I'll confirm.

re lunch.  i can do any day next week except mon or tues.  and any day the following week.

actually, they made me an offer on monday, 4/01 and i left on holiday on tuesday.  i did go in that tues am to see if i could get more $ from them, of course the pay/bo is less than here.  they didn't think there was anything they could do.

got back into office on wed.  played phone tag all wed.  they called me thurs [yesterday] right before lunch and said could give me a very nice sign on bonus...but nothing more to my base pay.  thought hard about it, and decided to accept, which i did yesterday.  they sent a letter over this pm and then went in to talk to jesus.

i am part of the liquidation pool, but do not feel comfortable at all that they are really going to pay me.  you know, if we sell $3 B you get xxx.  but there is no way we are going to sell exactly $3B.  and you have NO IDEA what you get if they sell $2 B or $3.5B.... and there is way too much loosiness involved in all of this, no letter stating anything, plus no trust on my part, that i don't think they will come thru.  and of course, now you have the SEC thing going on.  grrrr.

Since I got such an overwhelming response from everyone (Clarissa is the ONLY one that responded to my email...) about happy hour tonight and based on the rumors that I am hearing that a few people had WAY too much to drink last night, we are moving Steve's birthday happy hour to next week.  He says anyday is fine with him so if anyone has any preferences of where to go or when, please let me know.

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Major Business News 
Dynegy Is Mulling $2 Billion Investment In Enron in Possible Step Toward Merger 
By ROBIN SIDEL 
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
Dynegy Inc. is in advanced discussions to infuse about $2 billion into Enron Corp. in a transaction that may lead to a full-blown merger between the two companies, people familiar with the matter said.
A formal transaction could be unveiled as early as Thursday, these people said. The situation is very fluid and is subject to change, these people noted.
Enron has been rocked by last month's disclosure of a $1.2 billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by Enron's former chief financial officer. Last month, it reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter. Last week, Enron secured $1 billion in new credit lines, using gas-pipeline assets as collateral.
Enron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to raise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expected. Mostly, though, it needs to restore its credibility with Wall Street at a time when its access to the financing markets is drying up.
Enron, Houston, declined to comment. Dynegy couldn't be reached for comment. 
News of the Dynegy discussions was first reported on CNBC.

This is what I want, at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor.  I prefer a shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing.

Make it happen buddy - and remember, I'm not made of money.

I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k.  How does the grass look up at
Dad's.  I am thinking we should maybe bale the hay.  I have intentions of
going up there this coming weekend.  You should have bought a boat during
the boat show.  I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him
about a boat.  Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat?  Freshwater or
Saltwater.  I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha.  A friend of mine
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston
Whaler.  I think the boat was around 21/23 '.  The sides were approximately
6/8" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directly
behind that which served as a seat.  It also had what I call a jack plate on
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom.  He
could run in about 8" of h2o.  If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150
horse Yamaha.  That baby would fly.  They are bay boats but Aubrey took his
out in the Gulf frequently.  You should call Duane Davis.  I bet he can find
you exactly what you want.

Buddy, did the Easter Bunny come to see you?

Be Safe!

Yo Bro,

Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida.  I had fun
at Disney.  The airshow was a bit of a let down though.  AND NO, I didn't
buy an airplane.  Now I'm thinking ... boat... yeah that sounds real good.
See what you can find me.

I'm tired of my Ford Explorer.  However, I checked new car prices on the
internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer.  New
cars are so expensive.  So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy.

Just came in to work for a few min.  Later.

Per VNG's request, ENA released 700 dt of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 1/1/2001 - 12/31/2001.  Yesterday, CGAS informed me that Nabisco has not paid any of their bills.  CGAS was under the impression that ENA should be paying Nabisco's bill.  I told CGAS to find chat with the company doing the nominations for Nabisco and to keep me informed.

I've would like to wire Reliant $9,500.00 tomorrow and then wire about $31,000.00 every Thursday to keep Reliant paid for 7 days of gas.  I'm making the following assumptions;
	1.  ENA will be maintaining this deal through March 31, 2002
	2.  Prices are going to remain flat for the next 2 months
	3.  Tallahassee will call on the maximum swing volumes every day

So far this month, Tallahassee has called on the maximum swing volumes every day.  I will make adjustments to the Thursday wire amount as needed based on prices and how much Tallahassee calls on.

The following worksheet projects how much we need to send Reliant each week and shows what days Tallahassee called on the swing gas.  Phil, you mentioned adding a column for the sales price to Tallahassee.  Sounds good to me.  This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/Tallahassee Swing Cash Flow.xls

 

The following worksheet shows ENA's activity with Reliant, our current cash balance with Reliant, how much gas we have purchased, and what price we used.
I will send the following worksheet to Reliant each week.  I also plan to copy Phil, Robin, and Margaret.  This file is located at o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/City of Tallahassee/ENA-Reliant Prepay.xls

 

Eric, Doug, Phil,   let me know what you think about the wire for Friday and every Thursday.

Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in my notes.

ENA is wiring Reliant $20,000.00 today at 3:30 PM.  My goal is to send Reliant a wire every Thursday that will cover all ENA purchases for the next 7 days.

Jim, your contact on Monday will be Robin Barbe.  Her number is 713-853-7177.

Hi All-

Just thought I'd let you know that I've accepted a new position within EnronOnline and I'll be moving back to Houston in early December.  Should be fun!  I'm looking forward to seeing you all soon and getting back into the swing of things.  

Hope all is well-

I moved the sale to NYPA at Mamou from TP3 to TP1 effective 10/1/2001.  The old deal number is 815952.  The new deal number is 1063956.

Kimat, I just took the volumes to 0 effective 10/1/2001 on deal 815952.  Should we just delete the lines on the deal ticket for dates after 10/1/2001?

Effective 10/1/2001, the primary desk for transport on TGT will be TP1.

BETH!!!  Donna!!!   Welcome to the party!

Wade, I don't know how to handle these deals in Sitara or Tagg but I bet someone on this distribution does.  

1.  Does anyone have any idea on how to stop deals 340305 and 332163 from creating an invoice each month?

2.  There are deal volumes in Sitara for the East, Central and West desk.  Should these volumes be zeroed out or should we just focus on keeping tagg updated and not worry about Sitara?  Maybe someone is working on the Sitara deal volumes.

Chris -Can we get these deals fixed (delete the triggers) so they can be reversed (corrected) in Unify?  We have April-02 out on A/R all ready, but May-02 is still in draft status (we have not closed the accrual/accounting month change in Unify for ENA).

The sooner the better.  Please let me know.

Thanks  WRP

I don't think the triggers are correct.

Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.  Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?  One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.  We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.  These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.

Please check into deals 332163 and 340305 for sales invoices to Midland Cogen.  Max Doner thought these deals would not trigger activity anymore per your note to him on 5/13.  I see where these deals were updated by you on that date.  Are the deals legit, or are the triggers generated legit.  Please let me know ASAP.

Here's what Beverly had to say.


Tell Chris hi for me too. And, congrats on the new baby!  This reorg is
going to be very interesting.  You are going to have scheduling people doing
contracts and accounting and vice versa.  They haven't announced who is
working for who yet, but we are getting the operations accounting people and
their manager.  Then, we are going from 4 teams to 3 big ones.  We'll see.
Supposedly, the managers are dividing up the customers first under the
managers, then putting us wherever they want, I guess.  It's kind of crazy
around here.  Let me put it this way - if the industry didn't suck right
now, I'd look for a new job.  This company is weird.  It takes them forever
to do anything, then they don't have the right people in the right places.
Plus, they are very, let's say conservative, instead of 'cheap'.  When you
are used to the best money can buy, like at Enron, then you go to a company
that complains if you throw away a paper clip, well, you get the picture?
No wonder it's taken them 5 years to get 1Line, which, by the way, still
doesn't work too well!!

I need your expertise.  If ENA nominated this gas, and I think we did based on what I see in Unify, then we are supposed to pay for it.  So I just need to verify with you  we TOOK this gas by nominating it.

I just created deal 1204869 per the notes in o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy/Storage Inventory/Daily Inventory Update.xls, an ENA sale to PanCanadian Energy Services Inc with the following details;
Price:		$2.25
Volume:	1,121,702
Location:	MPC/Dry Creek Storage/2-02125-1

Rita, there is a storage contract 7010 in Unify for MPC.  I assume this is the contract that needs to be pathed in Unify to withdraw the storage gas.  Do you get any statements from MPC?

Chris,

The New Power Company deal #649352 has a demand charge (income) of $1,183,732 that you added.  Do they owe us this money and how is it related to this deal.
I looked in your demand charge spreadsheet to see if we reflected it in our P&L through a reimbursement but am unable to find it.

Your help and input would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks

Kam

This should be a short (less than 30 minutes) meeting.  Shemin and I are available anytime Monday after lunch.  I believe Ed is available after lunch as well.  Please let Daniel and I know when you are available after lunch on Monday and Daniel will get us a conference room.

I am starting to path it up right now, I have a question regarding the volume. The way I have interpreted these e-mails, we should be withdrawing a total of 310,000 from dawn storage, right now deal1199439 is set up to deliver 327,081. I can adjust the back end days to reduce our deliveries down to 310,000, just want to be sure this is our target #.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 
Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 
        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.
Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 
 
Any comments or questions?

not unless EES had some TCO storage we were not aware of.  They would be doing something with 620,000 if they were fooling with our stuff.

   I've requested a prepayment for Wed in the amount of $42,000.00 due
the
   rise in cash prices.  I've also added a new and exciting "Summary"
tab
   to the worksheet.  That shows when the wires are made and my summary
   purchases for the month.  One thing I don't have access to is any
   information that identifies the wire.

   Jim, Pete, Shawn, let me know if you have anything you would like me
to
   add to this worksheet and go ahead and hit Jim up for a free lunch.
   That's what I plan to do.

Subject:	PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

The baby would be automatically covered for up to 30 days.  I would need to get a social security number and then file the paper work.

Insurance and benefit questions

My girlfriend and I are expecting a baby and the due date is May 7th.  She
works for Williams and I work for Ed McMichael in the estate group.

We are currently living together but we have no immediate plans to get
married.  Also, she plans on taking off 6 months after the baby is born.
According to my girlfriends HR rep, her insurance will cover her for 12
weeks from the date the baby is born, after that she has to sign up for
COBRA.

These are my questions

When can I cover the baby under my insurance?

Will there be any problems moving the baby's coverage to her insurance
beginning 1/1/2003?

Can I cover my girlfriend under my insurance during her leave of absence
from Williams?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate.

I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?

Thanks

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Lunch on Friday sounds great.

Looks like I'll be walking over again today without my buddy.  He works for Northern and he's waiting for a termination letter from Enron and an offer letter from Dynegy.

Maybe I'll see you there!!!   A fellow can always hope.  Indrid still hasn't got me a rind either.  I bet she doesn't marry me now.

I like to have all options open. Look for jobs and work on getting something
lined up. If a company really wants you... they will wait for you. Lot's of
times they will pay you the cash that you are waiting for at your current
company... severance/bonus... etc.

We are looking for folks.. you can send me your resume. They need traders,
capacity folks, schedulers, and of course my errand boy too. Finally, we are
starting to expand since bankruptcy is behind us!!!

Sure.  I'll be there Monday morning.  Ingrid woudl probably like it too.
What would you have me do?

Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA.  Talk about a
change in location.  I thought that was nice of him to offer though.

So what do you think?  Wait and see if there is any severance, maybe a job,
or activly look for a new job?

I'm using March pricing for TCO and Sonat.  For TCO, I'm using the financial basis offer for March provided by Dan Junek at AES at 9:45 AM, $.125.  Sonat basis is not as liquid so I'm using the Inside Ferc differential for Feb 2002.  For Feb 2002, Henry Hub is $2.03 and Sonat is $1.99, ($.04).  At 10:00 AM, NYMX for March 2002 is $2.36

TCO Value	$2.485 = $2.36 + $.125

Sonat Value	$2.32 = $2.36 + ($.04)

Margaret
I've attached the prepayment request.  The physical address for the bank is

	Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
	C/O Bank Of America
	File  #96264
	840 S. Canal Street, 6th Floor
	Chicago, IL  60693

The address of the company we are doing business is 

	Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company
	Nine Greenway Plaza
	Houston, TX  77046

The person I negotiated the deal with is Andy Armstrong, his number is 832-676-5120.
The person at El Paso Corporate Credit (Tennessee is a sub of El Paso) is Julie Baker, her number is 713-420-7446.


Eric,  Julie at El Paso said the only reason she is requiring a prepay for this small an amount is because her records show that ENA has not paid any monies for anything on the El Paso pipelines, including Tennessee, Sonat, ANR, or El Paso Pipeline.  I know that we should have at least paid for the Bear Creek storage on Tennessee.

Subject:	RE: Dominion prepay for City of Tallahassee deal for March 2002

I just went over the March prepayment with David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion.  On Thursday, ENA will wire $280,306.00 to Dominion.  The Force Majeure event has ended and Dominion will resume deliveries effective 2/26/02.  We are assuming Dominion did not deliver any gas for Feb 8th through Feb 25th, 18 days.  Following are my calculations

	Prepay for March 2002			10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422.00
	Non deliveries for Feb 2002	           10,000 dth per day x 18 days x $2.1562 = ($388,116.00)

						Amount to wire on 2/28/02 ==>		$280,306.00

There may have been some gas flow on Feb 8th, but David will let us know about that later.

Doug, do I need to prepare a new Cash Use Approval Request form?

I'm requesting the prepay for Dominion for March 2002.  I printed out the request, signed it, and gave it to Doug.  I just want everyone to be aware of what is happening with Dominion.  Dominion is still not delivering the gas to Tallahassee due to a Force Majeure event.  We are expecting gas to flow any day, hopefully by the weekend.

Eric, I left a message for David Walker (405-749-5240) at Dominion to call me about the prepayment amount.  Following are my calculations

Prepay for March 2002		10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $2.1562 = $668,422
Non deliveries for Feb 2002	10,000 dth per day x 14 days x $2.1562 = ($301,868)

				Estimated payment due 2/28/02	               $366,554

As of today Mops has been down from Feb 8th - 21st, 14 days.  Mops may not come up until the weekend or early next week.  I will adjust the prepayment as needed next week.

Demand charges are showing up now.  We still have a problem with the 9th (4500 @ $5.445), this should not be on the invoice.  My Transco scheduler has informed me that they have taken the volume to 0 in Unify and that this item will need to be "actualized" 0 by volume management.  I don't know how that part works.

Dara, are you volume manangement??

I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule.  AS (tariff sheet #205) and IPP (tariff sheet #215) are separate rate schedules in the tariff.  AS pools are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a specific geographical location on the pipeline.  AS pool meters can be used as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP Pool meters are not.

Two quick questions:

1.   The Columbia Gas motion refers to two pooling agreements, the IPP
Service Agreement and the AS Service     Agreement.  Ms. Shemin's e mail
attaches a copy of a rate schedule entitled "IPP Rate Schedule
Interruptible  Paper Pools."   Does this rate schedule also apply to the AP
Service Agreement, or is there another rate        schedule for that
agreement?.

2.   Can Mr. McMichael swear the affidavit with respect to the pooling
agreements, which are with EES, not ENA?

Guess what.  I have the deal numbers in my notebook packed in  a box - but Ed McMichael said we are not going to flow this gas until March.  I think he also said he is trying to resurrect the Con Ed deal - which is probably similar to the Lilco deal with respect to the pipelines it flows on.

Transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the East.  They assign the shipper a specific meter for that pool and you use your IT contract to nominate pool to pool stuff.  

I DID NOT CHANGE THAT OL CAPACITY TICKET BUT I THINK I WILL.  I'VE GOT TIME!!!!!!!!!

what is the lilco deal you are referring to?  are we currently noming this?  can't find anything in unify that shows that we are.  

what deal on transco would you need an it contract for?  

also, did you go and change the capacty ticket to reflect the release of capacty?  I'm not sure how to reflect it, but the ticket numbers
are 1190900, and 1190720.  I can do this for you if you tell me how it should be reflected.

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

EE9092.1 (Sitara# 10258, no confirms on file, in TAGG & in Sitara & DCAF, states that this is a rebooking of E23290.1)
EE9092.3 (TAGG states that this is a rebooking of E23290.4, as part of E23290.1; no confirms on file)


E23290.1 (states "Retrofit - Oracle  #52730.IB, 15419.02") 1/8/98

This LOOKS (at least as far as I can tell) like the volumes are a result of the Fuel Load need to support X HP hours for the compressor, this is echoed by a memo related to E23290 (looks like someone did an inquiry into this in 10/1995. I did a very quick scan of these "agreements" & it appears as all this looks to be gas for the "Hubbard Station" compressor fuel requirements (there is an Exhibit C that calcs out HP-hours into fuel requirements). Other than the SWAP confirms - - - - and this "agreement" I could not find anything else other than deal tkts. 

The "Agreement" progression (for the Compression Services Agreement) goes like this:
3/1/95 Compression Services Agreement (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - Amended & Restated 11-1-97 (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - terminated & replaced by 6-29-00 Compression Services Agreement (Fuel Calc in Exhibit B).
The Fuel needs are found in the exhibits. 

So, id according to the notes in TAGG & if all of these roll back to E23290 - - - - - here is your paperwork

Quetion about March 2002, it looks like the volumes used in the Payment file are the gross volumes from the CNR volume file, not the net volumes.  Would you check on that please sir?

Thanks.

Maragaret,
I have 2 prepays in this email.  We will not need to wire money to Tennessee if we can get TXU set up as a supplier by 8:40 AM tomorrow.

Note to all
The first prepay is to TXU.  I'm requesting $22,500.00 to be prepaid to TXU - that's about 5 days of supply for the Tallahassee deal.

The second prepay is for 1 day of interruptible transportation on Tennessee.  If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal.  This is what we did on the 2nd-6th.  I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th.

My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant.  I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA.  Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent.  However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes.  So far we have spent 3 business days trying to secure another supplier.  We will also be able to use TXU and Reliant as suppliers for any other deals that we are able to start up.

I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.

I just spoke with Theresa Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.

Thanks

yes, I am basically handling any "old" wholesale business which for now includes the FGT/Citrus, Lonestar and some Enron Compressor stuff on TW.  I do have a Sitara ticket that we are updating for the sale to TXU, just let me know the price and I'll update it.  I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.  Is Joe Parks leaving or something, why are you doing all this stuff now?

FYI:  I call it the Cleburne Plant and it is at the same point as it was for the first 3 days of the month.  The scheduler over there calls me every morning to verify.

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

Kay, per my voicemail, I need to meet with you, Ed, Shemin, and Wade to discuss how to handle producers that are still "attached" to ENA's pools on Dominion Pipeline.  This should be a short (less than 30 minutes) meeting.  Shemin and I are available anytime Monday after lunch.  I believe Ed is available after lunch as well.  Please let Daniel and I know when you are available after lunch on Monday and Daniel will get us a conference room.

Thanks

If that is the case then converting 327,081gj's to mm's yields 310,012mm's, so you are probably correct, I can adjust it to reduce down the 12mm's.

I am starting to path it up right now, I have a question regarding the volume. The way I have interpreted these e-mails, we should be withdrawing a total of 310,000 from dawn storage, right now deal1199439 is set up to deliver 327,081. I can adjust the back end days to reduce our deliveries down to 310,000, just want to be sure this is our target #.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 
Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 
        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.
Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 
 
Any comments or questions?

Spoke to Mary last night.  She's doing well and I know you both care.  She
said Bernie Max was in surgery for 4 hours on Friday to have a melanoma
spot removed from his collar bone - not good.  She found out about it
indirectly somehow.  Gerald and Shirley didn't know about the surgery
either.

I should have an update on our legal issues by the end of the day.

I just spoke with "Wendy" in the Cherokee County Appraisal District.  She
said all of Dad's property was transferred to us back in August of 2000.  I
told her that seemed odd since the property was still in probate.  She said
that there was a special warranty deed transferring the property to us and
that Mary Esquivel had agreed to transfer the property.  Don't know how
that happened and don't care.  She also said that we need to fill out the
ag expemtion on both pieces of property.  The one I have is for the 31
acres.  Don, she will mail the other application to you at P.O. Box 532,
Brazoria  77422.  She will also mail a copy of the last application Dad
filled out.  We need to get the completed applications back to them in May
(does not have to be May 1).

I had a letter that needed to be sent out today so I left early.  This is what I need and you can tell me what the process is.

ENA purchased gas from TDC (sitara #1143983) in the month of December 2001 on NGPL.  It appears that we scheduled the gas on an NGPL IT agreement to the NGPL LA Pool.  At the pool, it appears that we made some sales 
	Deal 1184526 Cornerstone Propane, L.P.
	Deal 1184587 MidAmerican Energy Company
	Deals 258085 and 315861 to Enron MW, L.L.C.  - desk to desk deals.

Did Cornersone pay ENA for the gas?
Did MidAmerican pay ENA for the gas?
How do these desk to desk deals work?
Did any of this goes go to cash out or did ENA go short and cash out?

Not a rush but I would like to have an answer by next Friday if possible.

Thanks

Ed, this gas was nominated on an IT contract into a pool on NGPL.  I am unable to identify the gas after that so its difficult for me to tell if the estate benefited.  Let me know what you want to do at this point.

Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment.  The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted.  If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell
him.  This was an ENA deal.

>     Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00
from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001
(sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would "file a claim for
administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all
other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the
close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it
appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.

Here is a quick update on how the Columbia Gas Transmission,TCO, bankruptcy hearing went last week for the EES issues:

TCO agreed to withdraw the portion of their motion that was associated with EES.  The pipeline admitted that EES has been using their transport contracts and have been paying their bills since the bankruptcy petition date.
The $2.1 million claim that TCO had been including in the Enron "set off amount" (i.e. the remaining demand charges for EES's agreements until the end of the contract terms) was pulled out TCO's Motion.
The minimum OBA/pooling agreement monthly balance should no longer be required by the pipeline (Note:  Originally TCO appeared to be using EES's minimum balance to set off ENA & EES obligations). 

I would recommend that you challenge TCO's operations folks, if they continue to say that EES must be keeping a minimum balance in your OBA.  If you have any problems, please let me know and I will get our outside counsel involved again.

Thanks,
Ruth Concannon

Dominion's lawyer left me a message that they are sticking with the termination.  I will send them a letter telling them that we will be covering.

Mark Ellenberg is off for Passover.  We can discuss options early next week.  I have beed in contact with him, and he is familiar with the issues.

The contract is a bit complicated.  I will prepare a contract summary along the lines of what Pete prepared for MCV.

MCV faxed their May 2002 requirements to Kevin Brady.  MCV is requesting 6,800 dth per day on Trunkline (MCV I deal) and 15,000 dth per day on Trunkline, ANR, and Panhandle (MCV II deal).

I assume we are still physically serving the MCV I deal for 6,800 dth for May 2002.  Please let me know.

Does anyone need to see the notices from MCV?  I am going to send a copy for Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and put a copy in our contract files here.

Thanks.  I appreciate that.  It is a bit gloomy and MOODY over here.  I
don't think too many people are excited about Dynegy but its better than
bankruptcy.

And I do appreciate the job offer, its just hard to do with a family.  But
I will chat with my significant other and see what she says.  I've asked
her about moving before and I thought she was going to hit me.

pooled wholesale and retail resources
figure out how to get the people together

we've completly revamped the sr management team
target recovery of $6 billion dollars for the estate team, this is not a book value or firesell value.
$3 bill in ENA, $1.4 EES  $600 mill enron canada.....so forth.
stan hortin   mike mcconnel looking at packaging deal and assets together to develope a new reorganized company.

2.
we are important, the people that is
all the difficult times are behind us
he understands our urge to leave

creditor's committee has approved the retention plan

plan brings substantial amount of money to bear 
jobs may change
email will go out next week detailing plan

3.
personal message

I can do it but I need to see the invoices in questions.

Lee Ann, should we be updating Sitara with this info or do we just need to tell you?

Scott, I know last month Kim Olinger was running Sitara reports for ?flash? maybe and trying to correct a few things.  I'm not sure what the process is now.  Should we continue updating Sitara for transport items?

By the way team, Scott is out till next week.

Rita,

Richard Hanagriff at Transwestern called and asked that we e-mail him our wiring instructions so that TW can pay ENA's capacity release revenue sharing for January 2002.  The details of the deal and my discussions with TW are given below.  Please send him the wiring instructions so that we can get the money in the door.

Please note that there will also be payments made to ENA under K#24924 for February and March 2002.  The good news is that invoice credits will be very clear for Feruary and March, since the deals were done for the entire month.

Richard Hanagriff's phone number is 713-853-6709.

Thanks,

Ruth


CAPACITY RELEASE REVENUE SHARING TRANSACTION

ENA and Transwestern agreed to share the revenues generated in releasing ENA's TW capacity in excess of our discounted rates on a month-to-month basis.  The agreement also requires that TW release us from claims if the capacity is released at rates below ENA's contract rates.  As a result, only K# 24924 (i.e. the San Juan contract) has been released to a third party.

Transwestern was able to release the 25,000 Dth/d of Ignacio to I/B Link capacity at $0.065/Dth for January 11-31 (i.e. 21 days).  Since our discounted rate is $0.06/Dth, ENA should receive 50% of $0.005/Dth, or $0.0025/Dth, for the 21 day period.  Transwestern's invoice for January 2002 business showed that a $13,687.50 payment is due Transwestern.  This amount was calculated from a credit of $0.0625/Dth for 21 days offsetting the $46,500 monthly charge.  Another way to calculate this amount is that ENA's portion of the capacity release revenue sharing, $1,312.50, was netted against the  $15,000.00 pipeline charges for January 1-10.

ENA's position is that the agreement entitled ENA to receive the revenue sharing of $1,312.50 as a cash payment during the normal billing cycle, and that the other $15,000 should be addressed during the bankruptcy claim process.  I discussed this issue with Paul Y'Barbo at Transwestern on February 15th.  He followed up with me on February 20th that ENA will be paid the $1,312.50 as soon as Transwestern receives payment from the outside party that picked up ENA's capacity.  TW thought that payment from the third party would be received in a "couple of days".

Today, I revised the $70,000.00 wire to $989,700.00.

This money gets applied to the following April deals on Florida;
			April 1st	10,000 dth x 1 day x $3.27 =
$32,700.00
			April 2nd-30th	10,000 dth x 29 days x $3.30 =
$957,000.00
					Total Prepayment
$989,700.00

I'm not sure if anyone is using the attached worksheet but I've included
the baseload wire and purchase information on the summary tab.

Chris

I checked our tariff and with our in house council and there is nothing that
precludes us from assisting you with marketing this capacity.  In fact, our
tariff provides for it in Section 28.15 of the General Terms & Conditions
(Transporter & Shipper negotiate a "marketing fee" for Transporter to
actively market capacity on behalf of Shipper).  So as not to set a
precedent of doing it for free, I've attached a letter agreement for a token
$1 marketing fee.  What is the protocol (and likelihood) of having something
like this signed?

Once the capacity is offered and a replacement shipper is found, all three
parties would sign a permanent release agreement, a pro forma of which is
also attached.  Basically it outlines who the parties are, what agreements
are in place, and takes all the liability (and right of first refusal) off
of you and puts it on the Replacement Shipper.  Enron has signed a similar
agreement in the past regarding the majority of volumes on the same contract
when it released them to ProGas in 1997.

Please call me to discuss and/or if you need the relevant tariff page faxed
to you.

this is what I expect to be paid out next Tuesday


I'm buying all the baseload gas from Reliant 

Tallahassee 	10,000 dth per day x 31 days x $3.57 = $1,106,700

MCV		6,800 dth per day x 31 days x $3.57 = $752,556

I will probably pay NX1 + .05 or so for the Tallahassee gas because I'm buying point specific gas and NX1 flat to -.02 for the Trunkline.  I would prefer to be conservative so bump the prices up as you see fit.

Hey, I'm older than you, therefore my life expectancy is less.  So I have much less time to spend QUALITY time with Little Wilbur.  I propose that I stay home and be a house husband.  You would have a hot (oatmeal) meal waiting for you when you get home.  The dog would love you, the cat would love you, I would love you.......

What do you think?

Stacey,

I am forwarding this to you from Chris Germany to handle. I checked the deal in Sitara and the contract that is attached is contract no. 96017703. It looks like there is paper however I am having problems with Live Link. You might need to check with Ellen for the confirmation.

Chris has asked a copy of the contract or confirmation on this deal. If we have both I would probably furnish him with both.

Thanks,
Linda S. Bryan

Well, I told Ingird that I was madly in love with you but that you
constantly rejected my advances.

AND I DO provide her with love and support.  I'm all over this marriage
thing and I told her "no more lovin until she makes and honest married man
outta me".  We get our new apartment on Feb 22 and she be living together
by Mar 1st.  Don't know if I'll be a married man by then or not.  We are
going to look for a cute little chapel type thing this weekend.  I'm still
trying to make her cat disappear.  I'm telling her if that cat leaves one
mark on my little Christopher or Audrey, out the cat goes.

I am in receipt of several faxes from Dominion Transmission Inc which inform Enron of DTI's intention of not crediting gas from listed meters/producers to Enron's pool.  Per Dan Baney of DTI, the listed effective dates are dates as of which gas will not be credited.  In some cases, they are taking back gas previously allocated to the pool. 

While DTI is asking for a signoff from Enron agreeing to these statements, we have not sent any back.  I have forwarded all of these to you for handling along with the many other issues between Enron, DTI, and the affected producers.

I decided to wait until tomorrow to do the prepay to go out Monday.
 
Margaret, for some reason my cash request form has Susan Helton's name on it and she has to sigh the wire I think.  Why wouldn't that be you instead?

Subject: Manual Wire/Check Requests


Folks,
 
Starting Monday, 4/22/02, manual wire requests will have to go through the Cash Management Committee (CMC) the day before payment.  This means that the request forms and accompanying support documentation will have to be signed by the appropriate signatories of the business unit (BU), the BU CAO and the BU Head and delivered to myself (3-6337) at EBN 714a or Drew Kanellopoulos (3-9424) the day before the CMC meeting.  For example, if you need a wire sent on Wednesday, 4/24/02, you would need to deliver the request to us by the end of the day on Monday, 4/22/02 so the request could be reviewed at the 4/23/02 CMC meeting.  Check requests should be delivered three days in advance.
 
The only exceptions to this process will be items such as same day payment for prepay commodities.  
 
We appreciate you helping us relieve the incredible stress on the system to get payments more efficiently and please pass this on to anyone I have missed.
 
Regards,
Doug

 our distinct personality, The White Knight, might be found in most of the thriving kingdoms of the time. Don Quixote was a White Knight as was Joan of Arc, the Lone Ranger and Crusader Rabbit. As a White Knight you expect nothing in return for your good deeds. You are one of the true "Givers" of the world. You are the anonymous philanthropist who shares your wealth, your time and your life with others. To give, is its own reward and as a White Knight you seek no other. On the positive side you are merciful, sympathetic, helpful, giving and heroic. On the negative side you may be impulsively decisive, sentimental and misdirected. Interestingly, your preference is just as applicable in today's corporate kingdoms.

Thanks Max.  

Per our discussion today I requested 64,000 dth per day from Duke Energy LNG Sales, Inc.  I spoke with Carl Haugneland and I faxed him a copy of the attached letter and excel worksheet.

Joe, I am mailing a copy of the letter with attachments to you.

The sale to PSE&G is in the New York book.  Judy is trying to get Transco to bill PSE&G directly for the demand charge.  We are still waiting to hear from Transco.

A physical forward deal with the reimbursement amount entered as an external fee in Sitara.  PSE&G would be buyer and TP-2 is seller (assuming this is a TP-2 deal).    What is the term of this deal?  Is commodity reimbursed also? Please confirm desk , provide details and I will enter the deal.  

Thanks,

I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet.  The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.  How should we put this in Sitara.  I'm showing a transport demand charge on the capacity deal ticket.  How do we get the money back from PSE&G?

Ed, per our discussion, an assistant from Shemin Proctor's Houston office is coming over tomorrow to help print contracts from live-link.

She will be over around 11 AM.  I am going to log into Julie Gomez's computer with my ID.

I misunderstood. I thought it was ok to pay based on my email from last week.  My contact at LD  (David Walker) asked me about this amount last week.  He didn't mention any other outstanding items.

No - do not pay.  We will resolve this amount with the settlement with Louis Dreyfus.  Does LD want to resolve all issues at this time?

I am requesting a payment to Dominion Oklahoma (aka Louis Dreyfus) in the amount of $10,334.67.  This payment is for gas that flowed in Feb 2002 to the City Of Tallahassee.  According to Max Doner, ENA billed Tallahassee for the incremental volumes and Tallahassee paid for the gas.

Doug, Drew, I am requesting the payment to be made on Monday, June 17th.  I will get the wire request from settlements, attach the supporting documents, get Ed's signature, and leave it with Susan.  I assume Susan will pass it on to one of you after she approves it.  Is that how the process works these days?

Subject:	Transportation notes for Feb

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

Guess what?  The house is unsured through July 21st or 24th or something like that.  I went digging through the papers last night and found it.  Guess who the Goober was that paid it last year???? me.

What I don't have are papers on the Silver Leaf resort thingy.  I mean I don't have a stitch.  That's ok - I mailed them a letter yesterday.  I'm going to try to get a gazillion bucks for it and leave you guys high and dry!   Whoooo hooo - Brazil (because of the ladies) here I come!!!!!!!!!!

Movies I want to see - Swordfish (John Travolta), The Mummy II, and a new Jet Li (kung fu dude) movie.

I'm still looking for a bay boat fella's - about 17-19 ft long with a 70-115hp motor.  I'm willing to spend up to $6,000.00.

Attached is a spreadsheet containing what MCV is claiming is due to them for non-deliveries for April.  Do you think the replacement price makes sense?

Thanks Renee.  Is there anyway you could scan and send me the the invoice
you sent us for $384,975 (your Control Number 103027)?  I have a faxed
copy, but the numbers are difficult to read on it.  Otherwise, maybe you
could just send me a spreadsheet with the numbers on there?

   After quickly looking at invoices since Jan 2000, it appears the
   majority of
   the problems started to occur in early 2001. There are only small
   rounding
   differences occurring in 2000. It also looks like there were several
   months
   where MCV overpaid the Enron invoice to comply with the contract price.

   Let me know if you need further information from me.

The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).  I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price.

Ruth, you and I are chatting about this today I hope.

Kam, I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month.  I don't know if you need to be involved or not.

Hi Chris,

I realize that you are getting bugged from a few of us in Canada for the Boston Differential numbers.  I am in Accounting and I am in desperate need of the Boston Differential for August and September so that I can finish my invoicing for the month.  I really have to have these numbers by the end of the day today (latest).  Sorry for being a pest, but I am starting to panic!  Please send these numbers to me or Nicole Laporte, as soon as possible.

Thanks,

We just require August and September, we already have July.
Would it possible to get the differential number before Wednesday? Our Accounting group requires this number for invoicing and they are a few weeks late with their August invoice and require the differential immediately.
Please let me know,

Sorry about the delay.  I'm starting to look at this again.  I know you need August and September.  Did you say you also need July?  

I don't know if Canada makes any money off this deal but my book is taking a beating.  Ruth Concannon and I are meeting Wednesday to discuss this deal.  There are some other things going on with this deal that she is aware of.  I should have your prices by them.

Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.

Do my prepays to Reliant for gas fall under your exception comment below even though they are not same day payments?
 
I can prepare my weekly cash request for swing gas with 2 days notice. I will just need to maintain a bigger cash balance with Reliant - probably about $20,000 more than what I've been keeping.  Let me know what your preference is.
 
I have 2 important payments (estimate of $2.1 mill) going out next Tuesday that are on Phil's Cash Forecast worksheet but I won't know the price until late Friday afternoon - usually this only happens during bid week and I hope this qualifies as an exception (let me know about this one too).  I actually prefer to see the price in print the day after NYMEX rolls off.   I will also be hounding you several times next Tuesday afternoon just to make sure these payments go out on time.

This means that the request forms and accompanying support documentation will have to be signed by the appropriate signatories of the business unit (BU), the BU CAO and the BU Head and delivered to myself (3-6337) at EBN 714a or Drew Kanellopoulos (3-9424) the day before the CMC meeting.  For example, if you need a wire sent on Wednesday, 4/24/02, you would need to deliver the request to us by the end of the day on Monday, 4/22/02 so the request could be reviewed at the 4/23/02 CMC meeting.  Check requests should be delivered three days in advance.
 
The only exceptions to this process will be items such as same day payment for prepay commodities.  
 
We appreciate you helping us relieve the incredible stress on the system to get payments more efficiently and please pass this on to anyone I have missed.
 
Regards,
Doug

I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES.  Maybe CES should just be you??  AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if he is aware of any items not in Sitara.  But Ernie should have the whole CES picture nailed down.  I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and we not be involved.  I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email.

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
	Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we were not aware of.

Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

Subject:	FW: Sonat Park & Loans and Sale to Sonat

These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.

Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 

ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing an additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.



Chris's notes:
Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

I was speaking with Gerry Hrap and he said that they will require the number by tomorrow morning at the latest for negotiations with Calpine (per discussion with yourself, John McKay, and Scott Neil).
Sorry for the rush,

Scott is your main man - I guess.  I don't know if he is going to keep doing it or if he's going to hire an analyst.  I think Susan will be doing Texas Eastern.  Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on Tuesday.  I may be going Tues afternoon.  

When do you leave Houston?

Dominion Oklahoma Texas Exploration & Production, Inc (successor to Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp) is supplying ENA 10,000 dth per day at a Florida Zone 1.  This supply is matched up with ENA's sale to The City of Tallahassee.  I believe both deals go through March 2013.  I prepay Dominion for the supply each month.

This morning, I had a voicemail from my contact at Dominion, David Walker (405-749-5240).  His voicemail stated that Dominion was terminating their contract with ENA and Dominion would not be supplying any gas effective April 1, 2002.  Paul Vrana (713-752-4514) with Jackson Walker is representing Dominion, he prepared the termination letter.  

Just spoke with Paul (10:55 AM) - he has not spoken with anyone representing Enron but he has worked with Harlam Murphy?? in the past.  He will fax a letter to me.

Kay, I will leave a copy of the letter in your chair.

Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

Chris,
I work with Richard in the Chicago office.  I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston.  Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC.  The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled?  With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.

No I am not.  Donna Grief called me on Monday concerning this and I told her we would need Commercial's blessing and then approval by the cash committee.  I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.  I'm not really sure what group should handle it.  Is there an invoice that you can get to me so that I can have it as backup support for the cash request?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate. 
I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?
Thanks

Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.   And YOU ARE CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.

Hey.. how's it going??

How's your back??? How was Easter???

I may come down for the TCO/Gulf meeting in May. Have to get the blessing of
my boss first.

Who is doing TCO pool??? The screen says John Hodge... he is really a nice
guy.

Is John (can't remember last name)... TCO appalachian guy from CES... still
at Enron?? Do you have his number?? I've been given the order to start
finding appal gas... what a joy. I thought I would give Jim Javins a call
too.

Hope all is well for you.

Chris,

The plant was faxing this to Enron for them to determine gas scheduling. Since I have become more involved, I don't think the plant needs to fax this over to you/Justin/Kevin any longer.

If you agree, I will inform the plant.

Ed, this gas was nominated on an IT contract into a pool on NGPL.  I am unable to identify the gas after that so its difficult for me to tell if the estate benefited.  Let me know what you want to do at this point.

Thanks

Assuming all of what is below is all correct, it appears that TDC is
entitled to payment.  The question with administrative priority is whether
the the estate benefitted.  If we took the gas, I assume that we did.
THanks.

3/6/02 2:30 PM just spoke with Louis Schott (504-529-3630  Sr. Vice
President & General Counsel for TDC) - TDC has not filed a claim with the
courts at this time.  TDC is trying to avoid the administrative expense and
expects to be paid $203,196.00.  I told him I would call him back Friday
afternoon and give him a status update.  Please let me know what I can tell
him.  This was an ENA deal.

>     Summary:  TDC Energy Corporation is requesting payment of $203,196.00
from ENA for post-petition gas that flowed in the month of December 2001
(sitara deal #1143983).  TDC stated that it would "file a claim for
administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all
other necessary relief against ENA" if ENA did not remit payment by the
close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it
appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.

The invoice for $3,151,4550.05 is on SAP 3000012785

I found a payment from Duke Energy Field Services to settle storage fees due post bankruptcy dated 3/229/02.  These funds are on SAP 3000006586 in the amount of $2,735,550.05 - short from the invoice of $416,000.00

I have screen prints on each and will bring them to you and turn over to the appropriate party.

Priscilla was asking me if we ever paid for the Centanna storage that we sold to Duke Energy Field Services, LP.

I see that deal 1203368 was entered in Sitara on April 1, 2002 by Joe Parks.  The deal is a sale of 1,006,885 dth to Duke Energy Field Services at $3.13 on 3/30/02.  This is showing up in A/R as an outstanding receivable and Priscilla is wondering if the cash may be sitting in another account or different Duke entity.

Any ideas?

According to my numbers, I show we have taken 67,560 out of storage through
today.  And we are taking out 12,995 (2599 x 5 days) from the 27th - 31st.
Could you double check my numbers please?


Thanks

We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.

Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.  Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.

These are my notes on flowing gas.  Tetco will be the problem pipeline.  I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it.  I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00.  I'm using the following formula

	MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price 

They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem.  It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.  I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.  If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.

Who knows what volumes are going to be?

Subject:	Transportation notes for Feb

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

Now, I go to http://www.iroquois.com/igts/info/section-frame.html and select "Transportation" at the top of the screen.  
Then I select "Customer Activities" from the left side of the screen.

Please tell me your exact problem in getting into the EBB or the error message

Customer Activities on our website.

Yes, the capacity was awarded to Boston Gas.  I sent an email message to Jeff
LoConte and Liz Danehy about the release.  Haven't heard back from them.  I
told them they can nom on the released quantity.

Chris,
I left a message with our Credit folks, but I'm not sure how long it will
take to get a response.  Both the manager and the main person we work with
in that group are out today.  The manager's voice message said he'd be in
the ofc tomorrow.

Hector,
Chris called today to ask what we would require from Enron so that they
could set up an IT contract on which they would do only pool-to-pool
transfers, with volumes up to 40,000 dt/day.  Since we can't stop shippers
from doing billable transactions on IT contracts, I assume credit will still
require some sort of financial backing, such as cash up front.  I left a
message for Ken Newberry, but it doesn't look like I'll hear back from him
before I leave today.  Please follow up with Ken this afternoon if you have
time or with Leldon tomorrow.

Chris' number is 713-853-4743

Hector's number is 713-215-4256.

Thank you.	ii

It looks like we received 77,292 mmbtus back on contract PSNG2194 leaving a balance of 188,949 on deal #1222.  There was no activity for Jan. 2002 on contract PAL1001,deal 1424.  We were charged a total of $19,043.73 for the remaining volumes in storage ($.00305 per day).  Please let me know if there is anything else that I need to do.

Still not sure about the actual volumes for items 1 and 3 below but we did confirm that Sonat did not pay us for the volumes delivered in Jan 2002.

Subject:	RE: Sonat Park & Loan

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Chris, 
No one from Enron has told us they'd be attending the Houston Ops mtg.  Is no one coming??

Frank, I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email.

As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, "the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great" .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.


However, we do support intra-day capacity release.

Attached is a presentation from Dynegy that answers the question of " Will intra-day capacity recalls support reliability for the Provider of Last Resort in a deregulated market ?"  Dynegy seems to be saying "no".  KeySpan is the LDC that is suggesting that the POLR ( in their minds, KeySpan ) needs intra-day capacity recall rights to serve the market reliably.  Another question comes from this as to our larger business.  That is, Will intra-day capacity recall rights effect our business favorably or unfavorably as a whole ?  Chris and Maureen, I am interested in you thoughts on this asap.

Thanks

Frank

Good morning-

Can we get together tomorrow afternoon to go through recent developments in the Tetco and Sonat 637 cases, and the Transco rate case?  Other than Bob's staff meeting from 2-3, I'm clear all afternoon so please let me know if you're free.

Is there anyone else over there I should invite?

Thanks

These days, its easier for our legal department to draft or approve a new GISB than to find any of the existing documents.  The attached document is for Enron North America Corp.  David is going to see if they can use it.

If your legal department approves, please print 2 originals, fill in the Sempra information, sign it, and send it to me.

Natural Gas Futures End Higher

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX closed higher yesterday as traders
sought to cover their short positions due to a feeling that the market was
oversold following the steep decline of the last several days. The June
contract climbed
$0.04 to $4.279 per MMBtu. June rose $0.039 to $4.353 per MMBtu. The market
was basically just marking time until the AGA releases the latest storage
injection figures this afternoon. The AGA is expected to announce an
addition to storage of about 100 Bcf. A somewhat lower injection could spark
a rally because the market has already discounted a triple digit build.
However, an injection of over 115 Bcf could send the market to $4.00 in a
hurry. A year ago, stocks for the same week rose 58 Bcf, and the five-year
average injection is 61 Bcf. Since the AGA began reporting storage data, the
highest ever recorded was 78 Bcf in 1998. If current weather models hold up,
the Midwest and Texas will escape much of the summer's hottest temperatures,
and right now, temperatures are mild across most of the nation. Look for
technical support at the $4.20 level, and resistance is expected at $4.40.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada generally slipped
$0.10  $0.15 per MMBtu yesterday, except in the west where most spot prices
rose due to hot weather. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub
dropped $0.12 to $4.21 per MMBtu.

Enron's Lay Calls for Open Access to Transmission Grid

    Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, says that generators should have easier
access to the power grid. Lay spoke after receiving the US Energy
Association's 2001 US Energy Award, saying that today we don't have open
access to the transmission grid, and we could get more power into the West
if we had open access. He says the FERC should open up the power grid
throughout the nation so generators no longer have to pay a series of
separate fees to move electricity from one region to another. He also says
FERC has the authority to open up the power grid in the same way that
natural gas pipeline transmissions work. It's clear we've under-invested in
energy infrastructure in the last 10 to 15 years, and it's going to take a
few years to correct that.

Kinder Morgan and Calpine Offer 2 Open Seasons
for Sonoran Pipeline

    Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Calpine have announced that two open
seasons have begun and will continue through June 1st on the recently
announced Sonoran Pipeline.  A binding open season is being held on Phase
One of Sonoran - which would run from the San Juan Basin in New Mexico to
the California border - to give shippers the opportunity to commit to firm
capacity on the pipeline.  A non-binding open season is being held
simultaneously on Phase Two of the project - which would extend the pipeline
from the California border to the San Francisco Bay area - to give potential
shippers the opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firm
capacity to California delivery points.  Sonoran has received a binding
commitment from Calpine Energy Services for 400,000 Dth per day on Phase One
and a non-binding commitment for 500,000 Dth per day for Phase Two. The
proposed pipeline will be a 1,030-mile, high-pressure interstate natural gas
pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in
California and is projected to be in-service date by the summer of 2003.

Power Suppliers to Meet with California Governor

    Executives from energy suppliers are meeting with Californias governor
today, and several are willing to discuss concessions that include price
limits on power sold within the state. Last week the governor said he would
seek to force the suppliers to accept reduced payment for billions of
dollars owed by the states utilities. In the face of a state investigation
into alleged market manipulation, some generators are willing to discuss
limits on prices for some electricity sold to the state. Williams says it is
prepared to support temporary price controls that would extend through the
summer of 2002. Williams is also willing to discuss a range of possible
alternatives for repayment of past debts owed to it. Reliant will reiterate
an earlier offer to sell some electricity to the state at $20 per MWh if the
buyer will pay for the natural gas to generate the power. Duke Energy has
proposed accepting less than full payment for power sold to the state in
return for an end to state and federal investigations into the prices they
charged. Duke, Enron, AES, Dynegy, Mirant, El Paso Energy, Reliant, and
Williams will all send executives to Sacramento to the meeting.

BULLS CAUTIOUS
In spite of slip sliding natural gas prices, analysts are still cautiously
bullish. There seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish cause
with the prospects of hot summer weather looming."This is a weak market, but
I think that below $4.60 you have to anticipate the return of industrial
demand. It's really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edge
off the current large injections. Over the past month, the market has gone
through a major change. Production has increased, storage  is higher, and
the injection last week at 102 BCF was the largest since June of 1998,' says
George Ellis, broker analyst with BNP Paribas, New York. "I was skeptical of
 the whole concept of demand erosion, but it's obviously real and when you
combine that with an increase in production, the supply demand balance
becomes clear. There is potentially more room to the downside, but the wild
card is weather and if that kicks in, prices could move sharply higher. If
prices fell to $4.38 then that would be a reason to put on another 25%
hedge. As long as we're holding these prices I think there's a good chance
prices will rally higher. I'm cautiously bullish. I would not be an
aggressive seller," he said.

Blackouts Hit California Again

    California residents suffered through a second day of rolling blackouts
yesterday as temperatures soared, driving demand ahead of supply. The
California ordered that as of 3:10 PM the state's utilities must cut 400 MW.
Blackouts had been forecast by the ISO since early in the morning with the
heat coming at a time when many power plants are still off-line for
maintenance. The Los Angeles Department and Power, was as usual was excluded
from the blackouts. The LADWP is not under the ISO's control and has more
than enough generation to meet its demand. The ISO said demand was running
about 1,000 MW above Monday's levels. Earlier Tuesday, the ISO had projected
blackouts could be ordered before noon, but the return to service of two
500-kilovolt lines operated by BC Hydro meant more power was able to flow
south. About 700 MW produced by small suppliers, known as Qualifying
Facilities, are currently offline because they have not been paid. The hot
temperatures are likely to continue today, with the threat of more
blackouts.

I get the estimated prices from Jim.  Do you want me to make a prepayment on Wednesday or are you comfortable with the regular Thursday prepayment?  I need to know by tomorrow morning.  I have to request prepayments the day before the wire goes out.

Thanks

Kathryn, we are going to discuss what you and I talked about yesterday.
Can we just go back to ??Dec 2nd?? and terminate the pools without
Dominion billing Enron all these extra charges.  You and Patricia can

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

Just so you don't forget me.  I know its early but I'm interested in coming back.  I'm sure you don't know what you will need until after we find out what happened today.  Tom Martin was asking me if I would be interested in going to the Texas Desk to take Daren Farmer's place, Daren is going to AEP.  I told him I would like to talk to you about the East Desk first.  Tom would like an answer by Monday.

Let me know.

Kimat, I just took the volumes to 0 effective 10/1/2001 on deal 815952.  Should we just delete the lines on the deal ticket for dates after 10/1/2001?

Effective 10/1/2001, the primary desk for transport on TGT will be TP1.

Actually I am.  The little woman and the little bundle of joy both sleep in the other room.  Makes it easy for me.  My woman is trying to breastfeed.  I can't tell you how stressfull that has been.  There needs to be a class for guys on how to best support their "Woman" after birth.

Ahhh, my little bundle of joy is cute though.  And her mom lives in town and spends a lot of time over at out place which works out great.  We can go out for dinner pretty easy.  A lot of people don't seem to have that.  Judy said she would baby sit but it's not worth the trip to the edge of the earth in Katy.

Guess what.  I have the deal numbers in my notebook packed in  a box - but Ed McMichael said we are not going to flow this gas until March.  I think he also said he is trying to resurrect the Con Ed deal - which is probably similar to the Lilco deal with respect to the pipelines it flows on.

Transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the East.  They assign the shipper a specific meter for that pool and you use your IT contract to nominate pool to pool stuff.  

I DID NOT CHANGE THAT OL CAPACITY TICKET BUT I THINK I WILL.  I'VE GOT TIME!!!!!!!!!

chrissy,
what is the lilco deal you are referring to?  are we currently noming this?  can't find anything in unify that shows that we are.  

what deal on transco would you need an it contract for?  

also, did you go and change the capacty ticket to reflect the release of capacty?  I'm not sure how to reflect it, but the ticket numbers
are 1190900, and 1190720.  I can do this for you if you tell me how it should be reflected.

Subject:	Transportation notes for Feb

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

2 weeks ago, I received a page and the message box on my pager said "voicemail".  Would you see if I have voicemail and if I do, how do I access it.

Thanks

Mr. Germany - following are my notes per info Darla sent me:
Invoice corrections:
	Purchases on 4/9 should be zero.
	Transport charge is OK =  $11,274.31
	I do not see the demand charge in the invoice...
	Also need to add a credit cashout for 12dt's at cashout price.
I will be back in on Wednesday.	

Thanks Darla for sending this - don't let Mr Germany - slack off next week.

Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

Chris:

The offer is now on our Iroquois OnLine system and has an offer number of 50153.  The only thing I've added is Liz Dennehy's email address which I have as ldenehy@keyspanenergy.com.

Also the offer term end date is 4/1/2002 at 09:00.  If I left it at your 3/31/2002 09:00 then they wouldn't be able to nominate it on the very last day of the month.  Please let me know if that is ok.  Thanks.

Melissa, I requested a prepament of $45,000.00 to be wire on Monday.  On Tuesday you will receive our prepayment for the 2 baseload deals we did for May 2002, about $2.1 million or so, depending on where NX1 settles at today.

Our current cash balance for the swing gas is about $43,200.00 after making purchases for the weekend.

Thanks

MCV faxed their May 2002 requirements to Kevin Brady.  MCV is requesting 6,800 dth per day on Trunkline (MCV I deal) and 15,000 dth per day on Trunkline, ANR, and Panhandle (MCV II deal).

I assume we are still physically serving the MCV I deal for 6,800 dth for May 2002.  Please let me know.

Does anyone need to see the notices from MCV?  I am going to send a copy for Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan and put a copy in our contract files here.

Do you want to work with Wade Price on the Appalachian suppliers on CGAS?  I think we are still getting gas because contracts have not been terminated or something like that.  It will probably be tedious but it doesn't matter to me.  Just let me know.

Should I toss these 2 invoices or should they be included in the list?

I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?
 
Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

  In the past someone at Bridgeline would call someone at ENA or vice versa to approve the deal ticket so that the deal terms would populate the accounting system.  Note: this would only happen with Brigdeline because it is and Enron affiliate and because we are using the same trading systems.

Approving this ticket will give Bridgeline the ability to bill ENA.  I think there might be another way to do this without someone at ENA approving a ticket.  I'll see what I can do.

Nothing is paid to or agreed with Bridgeline until we reach resolution and get approval to proceed.  Have we received these in past months?  What have we done with those?

If it does not create a confirmation, what does it mean to approve this ticket?

Subject:	Bridgeline Invoicing

ENA and Bridgeline use the same trading/accounting system, Sitara and Unify.  In the good ol' days, the traders would enter the deals in Sitara (which includes volume and pricing terms).  Accounting would use Unify to track the volumes and bill and pay our counter parties.  Unify gets the pricing information from Sitara.

Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve Sitara deal #1190691.  This deal shows Bridgeline Storage Company as the seller of storage service and Enron North American as the buyer.  The demand charge on this deal is $313,500.00.  Bridgeline needs someone at ENA to approve this ticket so the Bridgeline system will be able to generate and invoice.

Would this have any impact on our Bridgeline negotiations or our legal rights if I approve this ticket?  According to Cyndie in Global Contracts, this will not create a confirmation.

I just spoke with Janelle Shaunghnessy (517-768-2076) at CMS Marketing regarding our March 2002 production invoice to them.  The invoice is for the 50,000 dth per day of Michcon Storage gas that we were selling CMS.  The total amount is $3,695,975.00.

According to Janelle she has not received the invoice yet so I just faxed it to her at 517-768-2110.  She said that they should be able to make the payment tomorrow.

1:28 PM, I just confirmed that Janelle received the faxed invoice.

Mr. Germany - following are my notes per info Darla sent me:
Invoice corrections:
	Purchases on 4/9 should be zero.
	Transport charge is OK =  $11,274.31
	I do not see the demand charge in the invoice...
	Also need to add a credit cashout for 12dt's at cashout price.
I will be back in on Wednesday.	

Thanks Darla for sending this - don't let Mr Germany - slack off next week.

Hi team.  I'm going to set myself up as the Navigator administrator for Enron North America unless someone else wants to do it.  We use Navigator for activity on Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf, Crossroads, and KO Transmission.  I think we also use Navigator to download the invoices.

I'm going to kill all the ID's shown below except mine.  Should I set up anyone else with an ID?

Are there any other Enron companies that you need to look at as far as

Below are two attachments; one for the new admin (you) and one to remove
exiting Nav ids or to add new Nav ids'.

(See attached file: ADD_CHANGE_ADMINISTRATOR_FORM.doc)            (See
attached file: ADD_REMOVE_USER_FORM.doc)


Since Robert Allwein is the current, can you get his signature on the
Change Adm form?  If you can GREAT!.....if not then the form must be
signed by a Notary.  Then you can go ahead and sign the forms to remove any
ids.

You can call me at  1 800 628 4867.  I really appreciate your help in
getting this account cleaned up.

Thanks,

HEY!!!  What's up in your life?  My woman is getting bigger every day.  I wonder if this little sucker is going to look anything like Duff?  We've been living in sin together since the last week of Feb.  So far so good but I do like my solitude.

I'm thinking about buying a new car.  BUT I'm almost always thinking of buying a new car.  I drove all the toyota suv's the chevy suv's, nissan and ford.  My favorite out of the pack is the ford explorer - GO FIGURE.  ITs more comfy for my tush!

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
	Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

I think it needs to be pathed in Unify.  Here's the problem.  I created a sales deal ticket and Kim and I didn't know if the supply just needed to come from imbalance or if I needed to create a one sided exchange ticket.  I have no idea how the ontario desk handled it in the past.  They probably were not consistent any.  Would you path this?
 
Just take you best shot on how to do it.  I think we are going to have quite a few things like this.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in a sales deal ticket for Jan 2002 on Montanna Power which is in the west.

Phil and I were just looking at some of the invoices created for March activity and I noticed the sale to MidAmerican Energy was not in his stack of invoices to review.  Would you see if we billed MidAmerican for March please?  The deal number is 1199439, the volume is 310,000 dth and the price is $2.47 per dth.  This was gas that the ENA Ontario desk had parked at Dawn.  There are more notes at the bottom of this email.

Good Job!  Please document the sale and the other bids, timing issues, costs, and any other factors that led to or affected the sale.  If you have any questions, please ask.

Just sold 10,000 MMBtu per day at Dawn to MidAmerican Energy Company at $2.47 for March.  My contact at MidAmerican is Dave Evans (515-281-2698).  Dave said he was using Apr Nymx + $.05 to calculate his price.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address? 


Any comments or questions?

It is over with.  The addendum may or may not be signed and its a seperate document and I will personally pay for all legal cost incurred regarding the addendum.  But the other documents are in route to me, i get it, i sign it, you and donny sign it, i send it back, waaaala!!  The lawyer told that once the documents are filed with the courthouse then everything becomes ours (I don't call the lawyer anymore because her time is "billable")  I don't think its that simple though.  What do you think?

So what are you doing this weekend?

Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed
by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a
termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't
include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting
with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original
agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this
lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW.

Pete,  I'm following up the voicemail I left you this morning.
 
In our initial discussions you indicated we could do business under an existing GISB agreement between Enron North America and Reliant.  However, our legal department believes all of our GISB contracts with Reliant have been cancelled/terminated.  Attached is a standard GISB agreement for your review.  I understand that you need to send this to your legal department to include any special provisions that may be necessary.   
 
Please call me at 713-853-4743 or Eric Boyt at 713-345-7754 and let me know if Reliant Energy Services is willing to trade under this agreement.
 
Thanks
Chris Germany
Manager, Gas Trading

We had a meeting this morning at 7:00 am but we didn't find out anything new.  Right now it sounds like its business as usuall for the next 5-7 months.  I had a jury duty summons this morning.  I didn't get picked and we got out at 1:00 PM.  Sell my truck yet?

Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

I just spoke with Theresa Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.

Thanks

I'm taking off Friday.

yes, I am basically handling any "old" wholesale business which for now includes the FGT/Citrus, Lonestar and some Enron Compressor stuff on TW.  I do have a Sitara ticket that we are updating for the sale to TXU, just let me know the price and I'll update it.  I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.  Is Joe Parks leaving or something, why are you doing all this stuff now?

FYI:  I call it the Cleburne Plant and it is at the same point as it was for the first 3 days of the month.  The scheduler over there calls me every morning to verify.

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

Sure.  I'll be there Monday morning.  Ingrid woudl probably like it too.  What would you have me do?  

Mark Gazelli at Cook Inlet told me he had a job for me in LA.  Talk about a change in location.  I thought that was nice of him to offer though.

So what do you think?  Wait and see if there is any severance, maybe a job, or activly look for a new job?

The two attachments show all the contracts that are active for ENA per Columbia's system effective 12/01/2001 and 06/01/2002.  This might be handy to have when we talk to Steve today.  The file name tells you what effective date I used on the report.  The effective date is also shown in the upper right part of the report as well.  The column in the far left indicates which pipeline the contract is for; TCO is Columbia Gas and CGT is Columbia Gulf.



 


 

The attachments below show all the active contracts for Columbia Energy Services (CES) and Columbia Gas Marketing (CGM) for the same time frame.  ENA is agent for both of these companies.

Greg
We've chatted before but you may not remember me.  I'm currently working for the ENA Estate team and I need to purchase some Trunkline Ela gas for April.  Ruth Concannon suggested that I contact you but she didn't have your number handy.  I also have other buy/sells that come up from time to time as well.  Please let me know if you would be interested in selling us gas. 

Thanks

Daniel, these are the notes I took from Friday's floor meeting.


Dan Leff floor presentation on Friday March 22nd, 10:00 AM
came here 5 years ago, Mechanical enigeer, sold his business FMES in 1997 to EES and been with EES every since.

we have about 1,000 people left in wholesale and retail
about 800 people in support groups
we've lost about 7,000 people since Dec 2nd.

3 things
1.  where is the business now
we know where we are, where we are going, retention\
pooled wholesale and retail resources
figure out how to get the people together

we've completly revamped the sr management team
target recovery of $6 billion dollars for the estate team, this is not a book value or firesell value.
$3 bill in ENA, $1.4 EES  $600 mill enron canada.....so forth.
stan hortin   mike mcconnel looking at packaging deal and assets together to develope a new reorganized company.

2.
we are important, the people that is
all the difficult times are behind us
he understands our urge to leave
take a deep breath, think about how what you do will enhance career.

retention plan should be presented next week, will be filed next week with the bankruptcy court.
creditor's committee has approved the retention plan

plan brings substantial amount of money to bear 
jobs may change
email will go out next week detailing plan
management will talk to people before next friday about how the overall retention plan will impact us and our coworkers


Liquidation bucket - people settleing terminated positions, assets, primarily commercial oriented.  Commision type environment.
Retention Pool - cetain amount of money is paid on a qtrly basis.
Severeance plan - safety net for people not in retention or liguidation bucket.
anyone in severance plan will have their monies offset by any monies they recieve  on one of the other plans.

3.
personal message 
be positive
have some fun
get a bounce back in your walk
you can be part of fixing it
take next year or 2 years to learn and develope.

queston:  what is the goal of the company
we are selling books of business, assets, and substantial amount of backoffice work needs to be done to do the settlements.
we are not going to try and develope new business.

question:  org chart?
We should be developing one over the next few weeks.

came here 5 years ago, Mechanical enigeer, sold his business FMES in 1997 to EES and been with EES every since.

Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at Doyle on Transco.  I have devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.  Poke all the holes in it you want.

Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy

The higher of
St 65 Offer plus $.35
TCO Offer plus $.14

Good Luck

Ed McMichael has signed the agreement.  One minor change, I replaced all "FT-A"'s with "NET-284".  I will fax a copy to your attention.  Also, does this need to be sent to you via over night mail?

Per our conversation a few minutes ago, attached please find the revised Stipulation.  This document has been modified with the changes that were in the mark-up you faxed to Toni Donohue here a few hours ago.  I also deleted "subject to recall" based on our discussion, assuming you get approval for that revision.  You informed me that you would discuss this with your attorney.
Also, as I mentioned to you, we have faxed your mark-up to Melanie Gray at Weil Gotschal in Houston to keep her informed.  (Her voice mail says she's out of the office until Monday.)

Hey buddy, this is out of a Duke Energy newsletter.  I'll just give you the highlights.

Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of NiSource, INC.  MHP currently operates 2 facilities.  The Moss Bluff facility in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La.

I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.  I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline.

Just curious, what are we doing with the Lone Star imbalance?  Given that our contract price is in the money and we've already paid for the gas sitting on the pipe, is there a trade to be made with Lone Star?

I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now.  This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract.  It is scheduled to come out on Sonat.  To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges.  But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.  I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.


We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.  I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.

Subject:	CGAS Park & Loan deals

We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.

Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.  Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.

Ilene Leahey is going to help print contracts from live-link.  She is from the local Andrews & Kurth office.  I have set her up at Julie Gomez's desk and she is using my id to print contracts.

She shouldn't need anything but if she does please help her.

FYI

I just checked the Tenn EBB and it does not appear that Boston Gas is releasing the Net 284 space to anyone.  I also just got off the phone with Ivy at Iroquois, she is the capacity release lady.  She said she didn't think that Boston Gas has been using this space at all.

Stacy, does anyone in legal want to be included on this in the future (especially since you are Scotland bound)? Or should we just coordinate this with Chris?

Thank you!

I'm trying hard not to call you and use up my phone call allowance this morning.  GOOD NEWS.  I'm reading an article on Yahoo and they use the word nebulous.

Enron is, in part, the deformed offspring of a move to deregulate markets. It played fast and loose in a nebulous world of finance that received scant attention from lawmakers.


I know what it means.  And this is only the second time I have ever seen this word used!!!!!!!

Gloria Barkowsky has access to Escript, but she is on vacation this week. I don't know if someone else in Volume Management has access (Rita??).  

Dominion used to send data files to us that, in addition to "current" month allocations and meter statements, may have included imbalance information.

Subject:	Dominion Imbalance statements

Kathryn (EES Volume Management) and I are trying to determine what the Dominion Pipeline imbalances are from the Appalachian producers  for EES.  Dominion will not tell us without making a formal request to their legal department.  We may have to do that anyway.  I'm not sure what this report is called, I just know its on a 2 month lag.  I'm also not sure if this report was mailed to us or if we could run it out of Escript (Dominion's EBB).  If it was run out of Escript, then someone in volume management should know how to do it and that person could show me.  If the report was mailed to us, then I'll have to make a formal request to Dominion's legal department.

Don't spend more than 10 minutes trying to figure out how to do this.  If the person that handled Dominion is gone, then I'll just go the "legal" route.

Thanks

Demand charges are showing up now.  We still have a problem with the 9th (4500 @ $5.445), this should not be on the invoice.  My Transco scheduler has informed me that they have taken the volume to 0 in Unify and that this item will need to be "actualized" 0 by volume management.  I don't know how that part works.

Dara, are you volume manangement??

Chris,
We will DEFINITELY pass the word and be sure to tell  anyone that calls
wondering what the BABY will need.  And of course we will try and get you a
little something from your baby wish list too.

I can just see the baby now....sitting on HIS Harley, watching HIS big
screen TV, daydreaming about the lake and HIS blue wave boat, while
wondering which one of HIS cars Mommie will be "borrowing" when she picks
him up from day care...or maybe he has visions of Nanny Terri Hatcher or
Nanny Natilie Imbruglia driving him in one of HIS cars.

Thanks for thinking of me.  Lia already called me and I contacted the guy at
Shell.  They're looking for someone to do refined products marketing and
transportation.  I'm not experienced in that and frankly not very interested
in starting something completely new in the energy business.  I'm too old!!

Hope things are going well at UBS.  Say hi to everyone for me.  I sent Andy
an email several weeks ago but haven't heard back.  I know you guys are busy
trying to get everything set up.  Good luck!

Take care,

Susan

Susan,
Lia Halstead called me to say Rafeal.pina@shell.com is looking for traders.
She didn't know his number and my contact at Coral didn't find him in their
database.
My contact said it might be Equiva even with a shell address.
Not much of a lead, but hope it can help.

Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?

Chris,
I work with Richard in the Chicago office.  I received the faxed copy of the Pegasys invoice from Houston.  Enovate pays two invoices every month, one for Enovate and one for EMW LLC.  The outstanding invoice includes past due charges from Enron North America. I spoke with Kevin Brady and he does not sign on as ENA, so can that account be cancelled?  With that, I am not sure why enovate would pay for this invoice.

No I am not.  Donna Grief called me on Monday concerning this and I told her we would need Commercial's blessing and then approval by the cash committee.  I agreed to handle it because of the urgency of it needing to be paid.  According to Kim, normally it would appear on a buy/sale ticket and therefore, Margaret Dhont's group would handle this.  I'm not really sure what group should handle it.  Is there an invoice that you can get to me so that I can have it as backup support for the cash request?

Beth Jenkins gave me your name as an Enron contact regarding Enovate. 
I work for Ed McMichael on the gas side of the Enron Estate team.  Kevin Brady schedules gas for the Enron Estate Team.  Kevin received an invoice from Peoples Energy in the amount of $1,380.44, it looks like this invoice has not been paid in a few months.  I just faxed the invoice to you at 312-541-2728.  This invoice is for a license fee and a customer charge for Pegasys, the system Kevin uses to do nominations on Peoples Gas Light & Coke.  All the activity is for the Enovate deals.  Doug Sewell said that this should be paid by Enovate, not Enron.  Kevin was told by Peoples that if this invoice is not paid, they will terminate Kevin's access.  Do you know who we could forward this too so that it can get processed correctly?

Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.

Ruth, remember that moorning you "allegedly" called me from Shemin's office last week?  You said you were meeting with Shemin and wouldn't be in for awhile.  I told you to ask Shemin "What the hell is going on with Dominion?  What's the latest?".  Well that's what this is.  Never got me an answer on that now did you?  I'm betting you and Shemin were at the Waffle House smokin'  cig's, drinking coffee, and eating hash browns that were "covered" with cheese and filled with "chunks" of ham

Shemin, how about an update on Dominion?  What's the word?

Just wanted to let all of you know that there's going to be another wedding
in the future!

Brent and I got engaged on Thursday night.  He completely surprised me with
a beautiful ring and a nice dinner at Mark's after spending an hour at the
Museaum of Fine Arts.  We're planning to have the wedding in Tulsa next
March, but have not set a definative date yet.

It's been a wonderful few days and I'm slowly getting used to having jewerly
on that finger.  (After a few scratches, I must admit.)

I just thought everyone should know since I've been harrassed about this
event for quite some time now.  :)  Hope all is well everyone!

Angie

Tommy, I see you didn't approve my access for AEP which is fine.  I only need access to all the Estate desks and I just asked Daniel to give me everything because I don't know where the deals are for the other desk.  I didn't know if the Central Desk deals are under Central Desk or one of their many other books.  I think I just need Central, East, West, and Texas.

But, maybe you can help.  My request for the Central Desk needs Darron Giron's approval and he's not in the People Finder.  So he's either at UBS or he left the company.  Do you know who I should be approving that now?

Thanks

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

thx

you know the talking part is hard because its so quiet here and i know some people just listen to other folks conversation to see whats going on.  it makes it a little harder to chat and I'm kinda self conscious about it.  i don't know why it seems so awkward here and not in the other building.

oh well,  YOU ARE MY HONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Scott, 

In reconciling imbalances with Somerset Gas Transmission Company, LLC, Volume Management has discovered two contracts that were assigned from CES.  If these are valid, we need to load beginning balances as of 12/31/99.

The contracts are as follows: 

Contract 
Number          Agent for               Type of Service Class           Rate Schedule   Beginning Balance 

3005            Dannic Energy Corp      Gathering       Interruptible   I               5,425 mmbtu 

3028            Thomas Leeper           Gathering       Interruptible   I               500 mmbtu 

I will also need a transport capacity ticket set up.  Please let me know if we should set these contracts up of not. 

Thanks, 

Sherry Anastas

FYI, I just bumped up the forecast for next week from $19,000 to $37,000 because Tallahassee took the swing gas for the weekend.  I've also put a manual date and time on my swing gas cash forecast worksheet.

A.K. is looking for the volumes and dollars on deals ENA has done since March 1, 2002.  I would appreciate if everyone would look at my worksheet and let me know if you are aware of something I have not included.

A.K.  I just includes the spot deals that we have done to support term deals or to liquidate storage/park & loan positions that we have.  As I said in my voicemail, you might also be looking for capacity release dollars as well.

That would be great if you could tell me.  I show we wired $22,500.00 at 12:00 PM on the 6th, and we should have wired $20,000.00 around 3:30 PM on the 8th.  I would be happy to include you on the schedule below that I email to Jim and Pete showing this activity.  Let me know.  You might let your accounting department know that we plan on wiring money to Reliant every Thursday, enough money to cover supply for the next 7 days.

Maybe we should have the transport books roll up into the ENA Upstream book - then us little transport folks could work with the wellhead desk instead of against you.  That way we could get credit for our knowledge even though it doesn't show up on the bottom line of our P&L.

I believe our new Tennessee rep is Sherry Glazebrook at 832-676-2635.  If she's no longer there then call Andy Armstrong in the bid room and he will find out who our rep is.  His number is 832-676-5120.  Anyone that answers the phone in the bid room should be able to tell us how our rep is.

Our rep at Iroquois is Robin Zaleski at 203-925-7274.

Re:     Market Area IT Availability  May 1, 2001

The available interruptible transportation service (IT and
secondary FT) on Transco for pipeline day Tuesday, May 1,
2001 and continuing until further notice is summarized as
follows:

Tier I and Tier II (only Sta. 90 through
Sta. 180 affected)                                      0 MDt/day

South Virginia Lateral Compressor Station 167           144 MDt/day

Tier III (Station 180 through East)                     0 MDt/day

Leidy at Centerville Regulator Station
(Only deliveries downstream of Centerville
regulator affected)                                     OPEN

Linden Regulator Station
(Located in Union County, New Jersey)                   50 MDt/day

Mobile Bay Lateral                                      162 MDt/day

As a result of unscheduled maintenance at Station 90 the packages will
be reduced as stated above.  This maintenance is expected to last 4-5
days.  Customers will be notified of a change in the availability of
interruptible capacity at Station 90 and Station 180 as soon as

Mark, I assume you are the person Sonat will be contacting.  Here are some items to consider,

	1.  Park balance on deal #1222  188,949 dth ( + or - 10,000 dth)
	2.  Loan balance on deal #1424  (96,000) dth
	3.  ENA sold Sonat 496,000 dth at $2.885 for Jan 2002 and did not deliver 418,708 dth (+ or - 10,000 dth, related to Item #1)
	4.  ENA sold Sonat 310,000 dth at $2.955 for May 2002, I don't know if this deal has been terminated or not.

Rita, Maria and I are looking for the Sonat pipeline statements for Jan 2002.  We have Dec 2001.  Would you see if you have those and let one of us know please?  Sonat may have stopped sending us statements, but this would answer my volume questions on items 1 and 3.

Margaret, could you see if Sonat paid us for 77,292 dth x $2.885 = $222,987.42 for the sale in Jan 2002?  I would be very surprised if they did.

Thanks for the information.  Sell, Sell, Sell!  Sell it all to Sequent for March if you can get a good bid and have them agree to pay the moment we/they get confirmation on the nomination.  Try to get other bids to validate as best you can.  Do not talk to Sonat unless you have to - - asking permission is not advisable.

Subject:	Sonat Park & Loan

Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.

ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;

1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424.
2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok?
3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat.
4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).

Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.

All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.


Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. 



2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat 
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount when the gas was parked in August.

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.

Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.

2/20/02
Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back.

2/25/02
Per Kay Mann - Mark Ellenberg is the legal counsel assigned to this contract.
1:10 PM.  Left a follow-up message for Patti Frances regarding our conversation on 2/20/02.

3/11/02
Per Ruth - Mark Ellenberg wants us to try and pull the gas out of the Sonat Pal.  Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) will find out 1) if we still have access to Sonat's EBB and 2) if we can nominate the gas out of the PAL's.

3/13/02
Per Christina - ENA's ID's and passwords have been cancelled.  Christina called Barbara Gilbert (205-325-7310), ENA's account rep at Sonat - Barbara said she would talk about this issue with Sonat's legal counsel and see if its ok to set up ENA with an ID.  Christina also believes we could sell the gas without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would use a specific PAL's meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream.
3:30 PM  Tammi Depaolis (832-397-1728) at Sequent is interested in buying this gas and she might prepay to get it.  She will see if they can take the gas without ENA doing a nomination.  I need to verify the volume parked and when I want Sonat to take it out.
3:40 PM  Barbara is waiting to hear from Sonat's legal department.

See that means I'm like Patrick Swazzie in the movie Ghost.  He was way toooo macho to use the love word so he came up with an acceptable alternative.  But if I die and I come back to haunt you, I won't be using the word ditto.  I'll probably make reference to a Shetlon Pony.  That way you will know its me.

Why doesn't Enron promote from within.... same old story. It just took a

Sonat Park & Loans

2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer at Sonat (205-326-2007)
ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.  

Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.

Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Dec 2001 or Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001 that ENA has not paid for.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].

Other items;
ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).

You are my hero buddy. 

And you think I should get married?   FYI  while everyone else has been stressed out about work, I've been focused (VERY STRESSED OUT) with more personal issues.  Every time I ask for some kind of sign, someone comes along and tells me I should get married.

Hmmmm.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.17 for Thur 4/18/02.  I checked on the price with Darren Farmer at AEP and he said that's where Waha was trading so I don't feel like we are being taken advantage of too much.

Subject:	Trco/New Power capacity for Sept 2001

In September, ENA agreed to purchase capacity from New Power on Transco.  The total demand charge should have been $9,000.00 on contract 4.0159.  New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it.  The actual demand charge billed was $270,000.00.  New Power agreed to reimburse ENA for the difference of $261,000.00.

ENA will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $270,000.00 and bill New Power $261,000.00 on deal 1110019.

Pasquallie,

W. Don Germany, Jr
PO Box 27
Cedar Lane, Texas  77415-0027

Actually it is not a new truck.  Had 33,000 miles, Ram 2500 3/4 ton, 4 x 4,
360 Magnum Motor.  Infinity stereo, bucket seats, nerf bars, tool box, bed
liner, camper tow package, 5 speed manual.  Oh, it is dueled out through one
catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound.  Makes me want to
race!!!  I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well.  Now,
Debbie wants it.  I gave $16,900 + tax.  It is very clean and is Sandalwood,
Driftwood or something of that nature in color.  Almost silver.  I have to
pick up old gray over at Jerry's.  Debbie said, it is going to be hard on me
to sale my old dodge truck.  I said Yep, had that truck longer than I have
had most of my women.  I really need to engage brain before articulating!  I
am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before
rain.  One thing is for sure, the economy is not faltering on my account.
Dow Stock is back up over $33.  Hooray, hoorah!
Needs to go to $41 and then I will be happy.  I spoke with Gerald and he
said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad's place.  We need to
change the lock and place posted signs at the gate.  I may want to put some
steers or heifers up there.  I am going up soon and having the tractor
fixed.  Reggie said he will pay us soon.  He also still wants the tractor if
we can hold on to it.  First come, first serve.

When is the wedding?  We're set for 11/01/01.  Be sure to take your sweety
out on the balcony tonight and gaze at the full moon.  It was sure beautiful
coming up last night.  We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket
and watch for the space shuttle.  I had a couple of hickies on my neck the
day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns.  Just
jealous.

My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate
within the four year period.  She still has some sort of scholarship but I
am not for sure how much it pays.  She is going to be a kinesiologist,
sports injury therapist.  I think she just wants to be able to touch
football players legs.  She will be 20 on 11/03.  I am really proud of her.
Cindy said Jaime has grown up very much.
You should e mail her sometimes.  I am sure she would like to hear from you.
Jgerma5@aol.com.

At any rate, be careful and be safe.  You should have listened to Maw, as
long as you keep your mouth shut and your pants zipped, you will be alright.
Shucks, guess none of us three paid much attention to that.  Oh, Jeff
Sherrar has a new book out. Rise to Rebellion.
There were some pretty cool dudes back around 1774/76.  There will be two
volumes to this saga.  I am half way through the first and you can borrow it
when I am through.  I sure like his style of writing.  His books are always
hard to put down.

After the split Dow Stock there are 120 shares.

Keep Your Powder Dry!

Yo,

Bro

Dow

What's happening?  I understand you have a brand new truck.  Must be
nice having money!!

I need 2 things from you.

	1.	I found the title to the 4 wheeler and I was going to
change it over to you name.  What do you think?  If that's ok, how do
you want your name to show up on 		the title and what
address should I use?

	2.	I'm getting ready to divy up the Dow stock.  How many of
Dad's shares do you have?

Last thing, send me a million dollars, I'm tired of working.

I'll be out of the office tomorrow so Kathy Kelly will be handling our activity.  Her number is 713-853-5858.

Thanks and have a good weekend.

Hey, Scott is out of the office, so I'm sending this to you.

By the way, I didn't know you were a STAR!!!  I caught you on Nightline last night.  You were right up there with Ken Lay.

Can you extend the following deal to 3/31/00?  This contract had a small amount of activity for 2/00 and 3/00.

Thanks,
