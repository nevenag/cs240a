the Status of ENE 16sh --------------- Authored by Jeff Dietert ----------------OUR VIEW  ENE is down huge -80 for the year and trading at only 75xFY02 and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock More pressure is likely today on the news of SP revising its long-term ratings outlook to negative based on the decline in market capitalization and ENEs additional draw on its credit facilities which does not change its net debt but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating which could break covenants and restrict liquidity  We believe the major issues are 1 managements ability to regain the confidence of the street and persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow  2 ENE must maintain its investment grade credit rating 3 ENE must successfully execute its divestiture plans and 4 ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book IF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears these fears could become a self fulfilling prophecy  In the potentially vicious cycle investor fears could drive the stock down the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE limiting ENEs to generate earnings and cash flow  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to clarify the issues  We expect ENE to put together a more complete explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to stabilize the stock   Ifwhen ENE schedules a conference call or road show we would consider this a bullish sign  Absent further clarification the stock is likely to continue to be weak   Our gut feel is that ENE can pull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to 25sh over the next 12 to 18 month period rather than break-up value 16sh-see below  We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery ENEs VIEW  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than an approximate 200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change With no further asset write-downs and roughly 890 MM in asset divestitures 390 MM India EP 250 MM Puerto Rico power plant and 250 MM Brazilian power plant in 4Q01 ENEs DTC ratio is likely to decline from 50 at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48 at the end of the year  After the close of the Portland General divestiture expected by year-end 2002 we expect its DTC to fall below 45 we are projecting FCF to be break-even in FY02  We estimate that ENEs interest coverage at the end of 3Q01 is 35x  ENE is currently rated BBB by SP and Baa1 by Moodys and would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade  For comparison purposes SPs BBB median DTC is 474 and EBITDAInt Exp coverage is 61x while BB non-investment grade median DTC is 613 and interest coverage is 38x IMPORTANCE OF ENEs INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING  We believe that ENEs Wholesale segments which generates 80 of its EBIT would be noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade  In addition a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger the issuance of 50 MM shares of common stock and 1 B in convertible preferred stock associated with ENEs off-balance sheet structured financing vehicles  We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an investment grade rating  Moodys has its BBB rating under review for a possible downgrade   Last night SP revised its long-term ratings outlook to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the companys financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to rebuild its balance sheet BREAK-UP VALUE  We believe ENE s Wholesale America 27 B in TTM EBITDA Wholesale Europe 900 MM and Retail 450 MM segments are conservatively worth a 4x multiple recent multiples have been higher but we are discounting due to limited buying interest or 162 B  The Gas Pipeline segment 820 MM and Global Assets 200 MM valued at a 6x multiple are worth 61 B  PGE valued at the divestiture price is 29 B Total asset value is conservatively 25 B vs debt of 13 B leaving 12 B or 16sh for equity investors in a break-up scenario  The challenge is if ENE loses its investment grade rating the value 162 B of its Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromised--leaving little for equity investors POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS  ENEs Global Assets portfolio includes assets with 6 B in book value ENEs total gross PPE is 14 B that has generated an EBIT loss of 18 MM EBITDA of 168 MM over the last 12-month period 4Q00 to 3Q01  The Global Assets portfolio includes Elektro an electric utility in Brazil Dabhol power plant in India TGS a natural gas pipeline in Argentina Azurix and Enron Wind operations These assets seem ripe for a write-down although the company argues that it has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not impaired  ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of these assets has not been impaired  The write-down of these assets would reduce shareholder equity and ENEs DTC threatening its credit rating It is not clear that ENE put all its under-performing assets in the Global Assets portfolio  There could be other poor performing assets in other segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS  ENEs counter-parties seem to be supportive and have not indicated any change in business activity  EnronOnline trading volume was slightly above average yesterday  Some energy traders have bought ENE in their personal accounts convinced that ENE core marketing business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have over-reacted  Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights solidifying ENEs financial strategy hopefully for a more complete discussion with the street THE SEC INQUIRY  We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow participated  We do not expect the SEC to find any legal wrong-doing--although this doesnt mean that they wont express qualitative concern over the appearance of the transactions This e-mail is based on information obtained

and what he did to earn the difference Same question could be directed to Bush the elder But after the politicians tire of wounding each other and declare a truce we may see some overdue action on the control of financial derivatives These are the investments often off the books in futures and currencies that slice and dice risk and have made instant billionaires but whose abuse has been disastrous to investors from Orange County to Long-Term Capital Management Hedge funds are supposed to spread and reduce risk in reality they are often used to make huge bets unknown to their institutional investors Accountants are supposed to enforce disclosure of all liabilities but many have become expert in the concealment of risk I dont profess to understand the worries some of my financial sources express about dangerous excesses in the convertible bond market swaptions and ever-narrowing derivatives But my unwillingness to break my head learning these intricacies gives the wheeler-dealers an edge Complication and secrecy are mothers milk to them while the average investors best protection is full disclosure When you flip over a flat rock like Enron or Global Crossing you see much panicky scurrying-about by those who like to work in the dark For too long new-economy corporate creeps and their accounting Heeps have hidden risk in arcane off-the-books dealing The new SEC chairman Harvey Pitt seems not to get it Stop pretending its a political scandal and start dealing with the accounting and derivatives scandal httpwwwnytimescom20020221opinion21SAFIhtmlex1015395556ei1en2af09e94be84eaa6 HOW TO ADVERTISE ---------------------------------For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web please contact onlinesalesnytimescom or visit our online media kit at httpwwwnytimescomadinfo For general information about NYTimescom write to helpnytimescom Copyright 2002 The New York Times Company

the Status of ENE 16sh --------------- Authored by Jeff Dietert ----------------OUR VIEW  ENE is down huge -80 for the year and trading at only 75xFY02 and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock More pressure is likely today on the news of SP revising its long-term ratings outlook to negative based on the decline in market capitalization and ENEs additional draw on its credit facilities which does not change its net debt but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating which could break covenants and restrict liquidity  We believe the major issues are 1 managements ability to regain the confidence of the street and persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow  2 ENE must maintain its investment grade credit rating 3 ENE must successfully execute its divestiture plans and 4 ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book IF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears these fears could become a self fulfilling prophecy  In the potentially vicious cycle investor fears could drive the stock down the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE limiting ENEs to generate earnings and cash flow  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to clarify the issues  We expect ENE to put together a more complete explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to stabilize the stock   Ifwhen ENE schedules a conference call or road show we would consider this a bullish sign  Absent further clarification the stock is likely to continue to be weak   Our gut feel is that ENE can pull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to 25sh over the next 12 to 18 month period rather than break-up value 16sh-see below  We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery ENEs VIEW  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than an approximate 200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change With no further asset write-downs and roughly 890 MM in asset divestitures 390 MM India EP 250 MM Puerto Rico power plant and 250 MM Brazilian power plant in 4Q01 ENEs DTC ratio is likely to decline from 50 at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48 at the end of the year  After the close of the Portland General divestiture expected by year-end 2002 we expect its DTC to fall below 45 we are projecting FCF to be break-even in FY02  We estimate that ENEs interest coverage at the end of 3Q01 is 35x  ENE is currently rated BBB by SP and Baa1 by Moodys and would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade  For comparison purposes SPs BBB median DTC is 474 and EBITDAInt Exp coverage is 61x while BB non-investment grade median DTC is 613 and interest coverage is 38x IMPORTANCE OF ENEs INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING  We believe that ENEs Wholesale segments which generates 80 of its EBIT would be noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade  In addition a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger the issuance of 50 MM shares of common stock and 1 B in convertible preferred stock associated with ENEs off-balance sheet structured financing vehicles  We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an investment grade rating  Moodys has its BBB rating under review for a possible downgrade   Last night SP revised its long-term ratings outlook to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the companys financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to rebuild its balance sheet BREAK-UP VALUE  We believe ENE s Wholesale America 27 B in TTM EBITDA Wholesale Europe 900 MM and Retail 450 MM segments are conservatively worth a 4x multiple recent multiples have been higher but we are discounting due to limited buying interest or 162 B  The Gas Pipeline segment 820 MM and Global Assets 200 MM valued at a 6x multiple are worth 61 B  PGE valued at the divestiture price is 29 B Total asset value is conservatively 25 B vs debt of 13 B leaving 12 B or 16sh for equity investors in a break-up scenario  The challenge is if ENE loses its investment grade rating the value 162 B of its Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromised--leaving little for equity investors POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS  ENEs Global Assets portfolio includes assets with 6 B in book value ENEs total gross PPE is 14 B that has generated an EBIT loss of 18 MM EBITDA of 168 MM over the last 12-month period 4Q00 to 3Q01  The Global Assets portfolio includes Elektro an electric utility in Brazil Dabhol power plant in India TGS a natural gas pipeline in Argentina Azurix and Enron Wind operations These assets seem ripe for a write-down although the company argues that it has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not impaired  ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of these assets has not been impaired  The write-down of these assets would reduce shareholder equity and ENEs DTC threatening its credit rating It is not clear that ENE put all its under-performing assets in the Global Assets portfolio  There could be other poor performing assets in other segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS  ENEs counter-parties seem to be supportive and have not indicated any change in business activity  EnronOnline trading volume was slightly above average yesterday  Some energy traders have bought ENE in their personal accounts convinced that ENE core marketing business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have over-reacted  Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights solidifying ENEs financial strategy hopefully for a more complete discussion with the street THE SEC INQUIRY  We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow participated  We do not
