region saw a greater-than-historical average decline of 195000 tonnes in September avg decline in Sept is 108K tonnes 	As a result of this greater-than-normal decline total inventories now stand at 1525 million tonnes -- nearing the 15 million tonne historical inflection level and down 24 from the Feb 01 level of 2006 million tonnes a 4-year high 	The reduction in inventories has certainly not been a result of strong demand but rather continued discipline on the part of major producers -- NORSCAN mills operated at only 78 and shipments equalled 88 of capacity in Sept 	We are encouraged by this news and believe that pulp prices could see an increase in coming months As we wrote yesterday we see 2002 as the cyclical trough yr with NBSK pxs averaging 510tonne followed by a 17 rebound in

region saw a greater-than-historical average decline of 195000 tonnes in September avg decline in Sept is 108K tonnes 	As a result of this greater-than-normal decline total inventories now stand at 1525 million tonnes -- nearing the 15 million tonne historical inflection level and down 24 from the Feb 01 level of 2006 million tonnes a 4-year high 	The reduction in inventories has certainly not been a result of strong demand but rather continued discipline on the part of major producers -- NORSCAN mills operated at only 78 and shipments equalled 88 of capacity in Sept 	We are encouraged by this news and believe that pulp prices could see an increase in coming months As we wrote yesterday we see 2002 as the cyclical trough yr with NBSK pxs averaging 510tonne followed by a 17 rebound in
