estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc in Beaver County Okla Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as a liquid point of supply Williams asserted that presently supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure Along the way the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co ANR Pipeline Co Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid To further enhance its supply options the sponsor wants to build a 97-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations the 10000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County Colo Following the open season Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co 75000 Dtday Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co 200000 Dtday Utilicorp United Inc 15000 Dtday and Entergy Power Generation Corp 75000 Dtday The initial term for the deals is 10 years except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years said the application Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers said the application adding that Williams was confident    that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months With the addition of compression the project could facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth the sponsor told FERC And that may well be necessary it continued pointing to stagnant to declining supply in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with projected demand increases As in many areas of the country much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of    gas-fired electrical generation it said The 11439 Mw of active winter generating capacity in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004 said Williams The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator Western Frontier Pipeline Co LLC and approval of initial recourse rates The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 794Dt in Zone 2 Under the negotiated deals reached with the four anchor shippers Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25Dt at a 100 load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas while WEMT would pay a combined rate of 30Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub

Susan Kaufman Paul Robertson Linda Landwehr Susan M Badeer Robert Etringer Michael Cc Subject FW DWR Contracts FYI  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation Best Jeff Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals SD Union Tribune 100701 In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning the states power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs In a span of three hours last week the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts a move the governor said stalled the 125 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a 33 billion rescue of Southern California Edison which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout As massive as the Edison deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of SDGE than the second reality that emerged last week Despite the PUC action on the contracts Californians still face the burden of paying more than 40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity Or maybe not While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said Bill Ahern a senior analyst with Consumers Union the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine We did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts Shames said The motivation to do so could grow soon he added Especially in an election year the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the cost of these contracts Shames said Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis Shames said Beyond the growing political pressure San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place He says Californias electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster said Aguirre who is suing electricity providers for overcharging There were other means to manage the emergency The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period First and foremost we should try to renegotiate try to get shorter terms said Gary Cohen general counsel for the PUC Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter Cohen said The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are just and reasonable FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief The PUC has made several filings pressing this point but has received no response from FERC For his part the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us and they have not done so said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate But we have not been approached by anyone Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements The same people speculate that the governor who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements may have privately welcomed the commissions action as a step toward revising the agreements Power providers meanwhile continue to support the agreements The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market said William Highlander director of public relations for Calpine Corp The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements with some 13 billion in contracts Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements said Highlander and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture San Diego-based Sempra Energy another major provider under the agreements also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state Michael Niggli president of Sempra Energy Resources said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour based upon current natural gas prices Its pretty tough to say Lets renegotiate the lowest price contract  Niggli said But V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies said Sempras contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to White said The generators say nobody asked us The governor says nobody has volunteered But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate Why dont we ask State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say its too costly perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register 100701 SACRAMENTO -- Californias new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices Moreover another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year The new power purchases which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority could add as much as 3000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 23 million homes - by June That would be in addition to the existing 43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators Many observers - even those supportive of the power authoritys goal to increase cleaner alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agencys rapid pace saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run Were dumping power and authority Chairman David Freeman is buying more power Whats up with that Its absolutely ludicrous said Harry Snyder executive director of Consumers Union which publishes Consumer Reports A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority even in a very hot summer the state would have about 6000 extra megawatts during peak periods when it needs 63800 megawatts about a 9 percent cushion That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are In a normal summer such as this years the state would have 10000 extra megawatts above the average 59000 megawatts it needs roughly a 17 percent surplus Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer The more we own of our own supply the more we can control the market said state Treasurer Phil Angelides an authority board member Said Freeman We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer That why we get paid the big bucks New contracts would increase green power In addition at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1000 megawatts - would come from solar wind and other renewable energy providers officials said Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts Bringing on 1000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the states energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent The long-term goal is 17 percent The remaining power purchased under the new contracts perhaps 2000 megawatts would be from so-called peaker plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers While not preferable to conventional generating plants they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service If California can build new more efficient ones it can retire the old polluting ones the argument goes Nonetheless critics fear the state rushing into new negotiations will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts They note that the authority hasnt completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the states power portfolio That assessment wont be done until February I hope they have a basis on which theyve determined they need those 3000 megawatts of contracts said Lenny Goldberg a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network a consumer watchdog group Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the states businesses are critical They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there Lawmakers they believe will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts theyve negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts said Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants help others finance them and compete with the private power companies Leading the 5 million-a-year agency is Freeman the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis closest advisers during the energy crisis The Legislatures auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month Its not an investigation said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Felton chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee But its appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law Keeleys committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authoritys actions could help or hurt the state Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the states work The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter We did what we could We kept the rates stable and lights on Freeman said Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 2020 hindsight

19 2001  Report Enron CFO Reaped Millions from Partnership  By Stephen Taub  Talk about the appearance of a conflict of interest  A limited partnership organized by Andrew Fastow CFO at Enron Corp since  1997 racked up millions of dollars in profits from transactions conducted  with the energy company according to The Wall Street Journal citing an  internal partnership document  The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals with Enron in  ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk of losses  Fastow and his partnership associates are said to have racked up more than  7 million in management fees and about 4 million in capital increases  last  year The huge sums came from their investment of nearly 3 million in the  partnership LJM2 Co-Investment LP the Journal claims  The limited partnership was set up in December 1999 mainly to do business  with Enron and big-time investors include Wachovia Corp General  Electric  Cos General Electric Capital Corp and Credit Suisse First Boston  according to the account in the paper  The gains from the deals were revealed in a report to partnership  investors  dated April 30 which was signed by general partner Fastow says the  Journal  Enron officials had no comments for the Journal in regard to the LJM2  partnership document However it would seem there might be some concerns  as  Fastow as Enrons CFO has fiduciary duties to Enron shareholders  On Tuesday Enron stunned investors with the announcement that it had  taken  a 101 billion charge in the third quarter due mostly to write-downs of  lousy investments resulting in a 618 million loss for the three-month  period  Downgrades Up Upgrades Down  According to Moodys Investors Service credit rating downgrades of US  corporations far exceeded upgrades in the third quarter In a press  release  Moodys noted that the ratings of 125 companies were knocked down in the  quarter while only 43 corporations received credit upgrades This is the  14th consecutive quarter that downgrades have exceeded upgrades  Among junk credits 93 issuers were downgraded--versus only 19  upgrades--in  the third quarter The ratings news wasnt so bad for investment-grade  firms however which experienced 32 downgrades versus 24 upgrades  Recently Moodys reported a third-quarter surge in junk defaults The  hardest hit sectors were airlines telecommunications motor vehicle  parts  and chemical companies while the strongest sector was oil and gas  Moodys senior economist John Puchalla said an increase in risk aversion  a  loss of revenues and the potential changes in demand away from travel and  tourism-related industries have weakened credit quality since the  September  11 terrorist strikes  Moodys also pointed out that most aggregate measures of corporate debt  protection remain stronger now than in the late 1980s and early 1990s  The  much stronger credit position of financial institutions also diminishes  the  likelihood of a broad-based credit crunch noted a Moodys press release  The press release also stated that the lowest short- to intermediate- term  borrowing costs and one of the biggest infusions of fiscal stimulus since  the mid-1960s as well as the fastest annual expansion of M2 or financial  liquidity since 1983 signal the return of above-average expenditures  growth by 2002s second half  Read

Gas Turbine Power Plant Project ENA and Crestone Northern Borders non-regulated affiliate met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer Secretary of State in Wyoming who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant expandable to 500 MW in the Powder River basin of Wyoming  Their angle is that the existing utility Powder River Electric Coop cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin As you may or may not know Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOPs certificated territory in the next couple of weeks There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this retail market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market  However they seem to have some political backing These developers recognize that they need Enrons assistance in developing this project on three main fronts 1  Power Marketing and Project development 2  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access 3  Regulatory and Transmission expertise Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further Therefore I am wondering if I could get a Sr Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions  I dont want to make this email a novel Thanks a lot 303-575-6473

the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc in Beaver County Okla Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as a liquid point of supply Williams asserted that presently supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure Along the way the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co ANR Pipeline Co Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid To further enhance its supply options the sponsor wants to build a 97-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations the 10000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County Colo Following the open season Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co 75000 Dtday Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co 200000 Dtday Utilicorp United Inc 15000 Dtday and Entergy Power Generation Corp 75000 Dtday The initial term for the deals is 10 years except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years said the application Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers said the application adding that Williams was confident    that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months With the addition of compression the project could facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth the sponsor told FERC And that may well be necessary it continued pointing to stagnant to declining supply in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with projected demand increases As in many areas of the country much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of    gas-fired electrical generation it said The 11439 Mw of active winter generating capacity in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004 said Williams The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator Western Frontier Pipeline Co LLC and approval of initial recourse rates The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 794Dt in Zone 2 Under the negotiated deals reached with the four anchor shippers Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25Dt at a 100 load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas while WEMT would pay a combined rate of 30Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub

Gas Turbine Power Plant Project ENA and Crestone Northern Borders non-regulated affiliate met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer Secretary of State in Wyoming who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant expandable to 500 MW in the Powder River basin of Wyoming  Their angle is that the existing utility Powder River Electric Coop cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin As you may or may not know Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOPs certificated territory in the next couple of weeks There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this retail market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market  However they seem to have some political backing These developers recognize that they need Enrons assistance in developing this project on three main fronts 1  Power Marketing and Project development 2  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access 3  Regulatory and Transmission expertise Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further Therefore I am wondering if I could get a Sr Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions  I dont want to make this email a novel Thanks a lot 303-575-6473

the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc in Beaver County Okla Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as a liquid point of supply Williams asserted that presently supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure Along the way the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co ANR Pipeline Co Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid To further enhance its supply options the sponsor wants to build a 97-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations the 10000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County Colo Following the open season Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co 75000 Dtday Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co 200000 Dtday Utilicorp United Inc 15000 Dtday and Entergy Power Generation Corp 75000 Dtday The initial term for the deals is 10 years except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years said the application Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers said the application adding that Williams was confident    that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months With the addition of compression the project could facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth the sponsor told FERC And that may well be necessary it continued pointing to stagnant to declining supply in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with projected demand increases As in many areas of the country much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of    gas-fired electrical generation it said The 11439 Mw of active winter generating capacity in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004 said Williams The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator Western Frontier Pipeline Co LLC and approval of initial recourse rates The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 794Dt in Zone 2 Under the negotiated deals reached with the four anchor shippers Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25Dt at a 100 load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas while WEMT would pay a combined rate of 30Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub

estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc in Beaver County Okla Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as a liquid point of supply Williams asserted that presently supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure Along the way the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co ANR Pipeline Co Natural Gas Pipeline Co of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid To further enhance its supply options the sponsor wants to build a 97-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations the 10000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County Colo Following the open season Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co 75000 Dtday Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co 200000 Dtday Utilicorp United Inc 15000 Dtday and Entergy Power Generation Corp 75000 Dtday The initial term for the deals is 10 years except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years said the application Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers said the application adding that Williams was confident    that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months With the addition of compression the project could facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth the sponsor told FERC And that may well be necessary it continued pointing to stagnant to declining supply in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with projected demand increases As in many areas of the country much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of    gas-fired electrical generation it said The 11439 Mw of active winter generating capacity in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004 said Williams The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator Western Frontier Pipeline Co LLC and approval of initial recourse rates The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 794Dt in Zone 2 Under the negotiated deals reached with the four anchor shippers Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25Dt at a 100 load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas while WEMT would pay a combined rate of 30Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR Panhandle and Williams Central in Oklahoma All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub

Susan Kaufman Paul Robertson Linda Landwehr Susan M Badeer Robert Etringer Michael Cc Subject FW DWR Contracts FYI  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation Best Jeff Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals SD Union Tribune 100701 In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning the states power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs In a span of three hours last week the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts a move the governor said stalled the 125 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a 33 billion rescue of Southern California Edison which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout As massive as the Edison deal is it may be less likely to affect customers of SDGE than the second reality that emerged last week Despite the PUC action on the contracts Californians still face the burden of paying more than 40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity Or maybe not While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the states electricity crisis consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised renegotiated or canceled Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the states economy was reeling blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically said Bill Ahern a senior analyst with Consumers Union the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine We did these agreements under duress and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation Michael Shames executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network in San Diego notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts Shames said The motivation to do so could grow soon he added Especially in an election year the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the cost of these contracts Shames said Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis Shames said Beyond the growing political pressure San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place He says Californias electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster said Aguirre who is suing electricity providers for overcharging There were other means to manage the emergency The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period First and foremost we should try to renegotiate try to get shorter terms said Gary Cohen general counsel for the PUC Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter Cohen said The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are just and reasonable FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief The PUC has made several filings pressing this point but has received no response from FERC For his part the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us and they have not done so said Steve Maviglio the governors spokesman We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate But we have not been approached by anyone Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements The same people speculate that the governor who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements may have privately welcomed the commissions action as a step toward revising the agreements Power providers meanwhile continue to support the agreements The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market said William Highlander director of public relations for Calpine Corp The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements with some 13 billion in contracts Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements said Highlander and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture San Diego-based Sempra Energy another major provider under the agreements also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state Michael Niggli president of Sempra Energy Resources said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour based upon current natural gas prices Its pretty tough to say Lets renegotiate the lowest price contract  Niggli said But V John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies said Sempras contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to White said The generators say nobody asked us The governor says nobody has volunteered But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate Why dont we ask State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say its too costly perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register 100701 SACRAMENTO -- Californias new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices Moreover another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year The new power purchases which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority could add as much as 3000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 23 million homes - by June That would be in addition to the existing 43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators Many observers - even those supportive of the power authoritys goal to increase cleaner alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agencys rapid pace saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run Were dumping power and authority Chairman David Freeman is buying more power Whats up with that Its absolutely ludicrous said Harry Snyder executive director of Consumers Union which publishes Consumer Reports A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority even in a very hot summer the state would have about 6000 extra megawatts during peak periods when it needs 63800 megawatts about a 9 percent cushion That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are In a normal summer such as this years the state would have 10000 extra megawatts above the average 59000 megawatts it needs roughly a 17 percent surplus Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer The more we own of our own supply the more we can control the market said state Treasurer Phil Angelides an authority board member Said Freeman We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer That why we get paid the big bucks New contracts would increase green power In addition at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1000 megawatts - would come from solar wind and other renewable energy providers officials said Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts Bringing on 1000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the states energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent The long-term goal is 17 percent The remaining power purchased under the new contracts perhaps 2000 megawatts would be from so-called peaker plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers While not preferable to conventional generating plants they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service If California can build new more efficient ones it can retire the old polluting ones the argument goes Nonetheless critics fear the state rushing into new negotiations will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts They note that the authority hasnt completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the states power portfolio That assessment wont be done until February I hope they have a basis on which theyve determined they need those 3000 megawatts of contracts said Lenny Goldberg a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network a consumer watchdog group Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the states businesses are critical They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there Lawmakers they believe will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts theyve negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts said Jack Stewart president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants help others finance them and compete with the private power companies Leading the 5 million-a-year agency is Freeman the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis closest advisers during the energy crisis The Legislatures auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month Its not an investigation said Assemblyman Fred Keeley D-Felton chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee But its appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law Keeleys committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authoritys actions could help or hurt the state Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the states work The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter We did what we could We kept the rates stable and lights on Freeman said Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 2020 hindsight
