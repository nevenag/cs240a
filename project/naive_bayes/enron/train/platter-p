American perspective Dear Friends The following was sent to me by my friend Tamim Ansary Tamim is an Afghani-American writer He is also one of the most brilliant people I know in this life When he writes I read When he talks I listen Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are in -Gary Dear Gary and whoever else is on this email thread Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio today allowed that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage What else can we do Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for 35 years Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those monsters But the Taliban and Bin Laden are not Afghanistan Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997 Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitated suffering A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are 500000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no economy no food There are millions of widows And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves The soil is littered with land mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done Eradicate their hospitals Done Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and health care Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only be making common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else is there What can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout Its much bigger than that folks Because to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West And guess what thats Bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants Thats why he did this Read his speeches and statements Its all right there He really believes Islam would beat the west It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view Hes probably wrong in the end the west would win whatever that would mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden does Anyone else Tamim Ansary Terrorist Attacks on US -

OR ITS AGENT - THAT DETERMINES HOURLY SCHEDULE  WOULD DELIVERIES BE HANDLED AS AN SC TO SC TRANSFER BETWEEN WAPA AND ENRON IF NOT HOW  WHAT IS TIMING REQUIREMENT TO NOTIFY WAPA OF DA HOURLY SCHEDULE HOW ARE HOUR AHEAD CHANGES ACCOMMODATED 	I am unable to provide any thoughts on how the timing for making changes to Western power delivered to your SC for submission as a DA schedule would be handled at this time  I will research and get back with you 	As a relatively smaller customer I do not believe that there would be much if any benefit to you or Western by participating in any of our load management programs 	The existing Western meter set is CAISO certified and we may be able to accommodate a third party polling the meter  I will check into it 	Unsure of what you are asking in regards to off ramps  Please clarify Russell Knight Western Area Power Administration 916 353-4523  Keith E Roberts kerobertspplantUCDavisedu 070501 0429PM  Hi Russell Bob Can we schedule a conference call for early next week between WAPA Bob Russell others UCD our Presidents office UCOP and Enron regarding the below info  A WAPAUCD meeting may also be desirable I understand that Sukhi has been discussing with you the possibility of utilizing direct access instead of PGE bundled services to meet our peaking energy requirements ie the difference between our total needs and what WAPA and our cogen provide  We are considering using the UCCSU blanket electricity contract with Enron to achieve direct access Below are some questions that we have regarding the potential switch but we are also extremely interested in hearing what you have to say regarding the issues at hand As I understand the process if UCD utilizes direct access DA then we will have to switch from XY to scheduling customer status- correct If we have to switch to scheduling customer status what are the key steps and how long would each step take 	if we desire to switch quickly a DASR would have to be filed with PGE by July 11th in order for DA service to start on August 1 	if above is not doable then a DASR would have to be filed with PGE by Aug 11th in in order for DA service to start on September 1 If UCD switches to scheduling status it is likely that WAPA would be our scheduling agent SA and Enron would be our scheduling coordinator SC What would be the differences in charges that we would incur from WAPA based on status quo  Do you have any feeling for what charges would be incurred by PGE and ISO If UCD switches to DA would our 15 MW CRD still receive the same transmission rates under 2948A I understand that if we switch to scheduling status then our energy allocation will be fixed based on a 5 year average load factor  How does this math work How often is the 5 year average load factor updated- monthly yearly other UCD will have a new 3 MW thermal storage system on line in the next few months which will dramatically improve our monthly load factor total kWh divided by product of peak demand and hrmon  If we are required to use 5 year average load factors instead of current load factors as is done with XY then the economic harm to UCD appears to be in the neighborhood of 200000 to 250000 per year  Id like to petition using a forecasted load factor to detemine energy allocation so that this potential switch does not harm UCD  How would I do this Is the MWh energy allocation that is determined through the above process a flat rate number that is used for each month of the year or does it vary month-by-month based on water availability  I believe it is flat through 122004 correct If we switch to scheduling status and if we have so many MWh allocated for the month how much flexibility is there for our SC to schedule the load 	The max schedulable load is our CRD- correct 	What is the minimum schedulable load- 0 kW 	Are there any maximum ramp rates up or down ie can we go from 0 kW  7AM to 14682 kW  8AM and 14682 kW  9PM to 0 kW  10PM 	At what time are loads locked in ie can SC change schedule 1 hr 6 hr 1 day before the actual hour As a scheduing customer we will have the capability to join WAPA load management programs- do you see any potential benefits to UCD Is our Siemens TSI Quad 4 meter available to be read by Enron  What type of softwarehardware does WAPA use to read our meters  Does this meter meet ISO protocols for revenue meters I believe that we are planning to ask for contractual off-ramps if 2948A becomes untenable due to FERC or bankruptcy court decisions  Your thoughts Can you think of any other contractual off ramps that should be pursued Thanks Keith Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap

arrived  safe and sound into Dulles Airport tonight at about 600 It was an interesting flight The airport in Denver was almost spooky it was so empty and quie t No  one was in line for the security check point when I got there so tha t went  fairly quickly just x-ray of my bags and then a chemical test to b e sure  nothing explosive was on them Then I waited 2 12 hours to board t he plane  What happened after we boarded was interesting and thought I wou ld share it with  you The pilotcaptain came on the  loudspeaker after the doors were closed His speech went like this  First  I want to thank you  for being brave enough to fly today The doors are now  closed and we have  no help from the outside for any problems that might occur  inside this pla ne As you could tell when you checked in the government has  made some ch anges to increase security in the airports They have not however  made a ny rules about what happens after those doors close Until they do that  w e have made our own rules and I want to share them with you Once those doo rs  close we only have each other The security has taken care of a threat like  guns with all of the increased scanning etc Then we have the suppo sed bomb If  you have a bomb there is no need to tell me about it or any one else on this  plane you are already in control So for this flight t here are no bombs that  exist on this plane Now the threats that are left are things like plastics  wood knives and other weapons that can be mad e or things like that which can  be used as weapons Here is our plan and o ur rules If someone or several people  stand up and say they are hijacking this plane I want you all to stand up  together Then take whatever you h ave available to you and throw it at them  Throw  it at their faces and h eads so they will have to raise their hands to  protect themselves The ver y best protection you have against knives are the  pillows and blankets Wh oever is close to these people should then try to get a  blanket over their head--then they wont be able to see Once that is done get  them down an d keep them there Do not let them up I will then land the plane at  the c losest place and we WILL take care of them After all there are usually  o nly a few of them and we are 200 strong We will not allow them to take ov er  this plane I find it interesting that the US Constitution begins with  the words  We the people--thats who we are THE people and we will not  be  defeated With that the passengers  on the plane all began to applaud people had tears in their eyes and we began  the trip toward the runway  The  flight attendant then began the safety speech One of the things she s aid is  that we are all so busy and live our lives at such a fast pace She asked that  everyone turn to their neighbors on either side and introduce  themselves tell  each other something about your families and children sh ow pictures whatever  She said for today we consider you family We wil l treat you as such and ask  that you do the same with us Throughout the  flight we learned that for the crew this was their first  flight since Tue sdays tragedies It was a day that everyone leaned on each  other and toge ther everyone was stronger than any one person alone It was quite  an expe rience You can imagine the  feeling when that plane touched down at Dulles and we heard welcome to  Washington Dulles Airport where the local time  is 540 Again the cabin was  filled with applause It has been a  very l ong day and one that I am glad is over I have been constantly reminded  th is day of the ar ticle in JAAMT that Barbara Williams recently wrote where she referenced the tornados in Oklahoma and said something like Do we g et mad  and shake our fists at God in anger No we go on and conquer our f ears and  continue our lives It is my hope that is what we do now Last n ight I saw a  program with college students where one of them said that at  their campus there  are no more hyphenated titles ie African-American  etc everyone is just an  American No one will ever be able to take that  pride away from  us20 Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at httpexplorermsncom

Wednesday June 27 2001 407 PM Subject Importance     High Sensitivity    Confidential This was just forwarded to me by my mom  You definitely only want to read this one during some quiet time 17-year-old Brian Moore had only a short time to write something for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting It was his turn to lead the discussion so he sat down and wrote He showed the essay titled The Room to his mother Beth before he headed out the door I wowed em he later told his father Bruce Its a killer Its the bomb Its the best thing I ever wrote It also was the last Brians parents had forgotten about the essay when a cousin found it while cleaning out the teenagers locker at Teary Valley High School Brian had been dead only hours but his parents desperately wanted every piece of his life near them -- the crepe paper that had adorned his locker during his senior football season notes from classmates and teachers his homework Only two months before he had handwritten the essay about encountering Jesus in a file room full of cards detailing every moment of the teens life But it was only after Brians death that Beth and Bruce Moore realized that their son had described his view of heaven It makes such an impact that people want to share it You feel like you are there Mr Moore said Brian Moore died May 27 1997 -- the day after Memorial Day He was driving home from a friends house when his car went off Bulen-Pierce Road in Pickaway County and struck a utility pole He emerged from the wreck unharmed but stepped on a downed power line and was electrocuted Brian seemed to excel at everything he did He was an honor student He told his parents he loved them a hundred times a day Mrs Moore said He was a star wide receiver for the Tearys Valley Football team and had earned a four-year scholarship to Capital University in Columbus because of his athletic and academic abilities He took it upon himself to learn how to help a fellow student who used a wheelchair at school During one homecoming ceremony Brian walked on his tiptoes so that the girl he was escorting wouldnt be embarrassed about being taller than him He adored his kid brother Bruce now 14 He often escorted his grandmother Evelyn Moore who lives in Columbus to church I always called him the deep thinker Evelyn said of her eldest grandson Two years after his death his family still struggles to understand why Brian was taken from them They find comfort at the cemetery where Brian is buried just a few blocks from their home They visit daily A candle and dozens of silk and real flowers keep vigil over the gravesite The Moores framed a copy of Brians essay and hung it among the family portraits in the living room I think God used him to make a point I think we were meant to find it and make something out of it Mrs Moore said of the essay She and her husband want to share their sons vision of life after death Im happy for Brian I know hes in heaven I know Ill see him again someday Mrs Moore said It just hurts so bad now The Room In that place between wakefulness and dreams I found myself in the room There were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with small index card files They were like the ones in libraries that list titles by author or subject in alphabetical order But these files which stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endless in either direction had very different headings As I drew near the wall of files the first to catch my attention was one that read Girls I have liked I opened it and began flipping through the cards I quickly shut it shocked to realize that I recognized the names written on each one And then without being told I knew exactly where I was This lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my life Here were written the actions of my every moment big and small in a detail my memory couldnt match A sense of wonder and curiosity coupled with horror stirred within me as I began randomly opening files and exploring their content Some brought joy and sweet memories others a sense of shame and regret so intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching A file named Friends was next to one marked Friends I have betrayed The titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird Books I Have Read Lies I Have Told Comfort I have Given Jokes I Have Laughed at Some were almost hilarious in their exactness Things Ive yelled at my brothers Others I couldnt laugh at Things I Have Done in My Anger Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents I never ceased to be surprised by the contents Often there were many more cards than I expected Sometimes fewer than I hoped I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life I had lived Could it be possible that I had the time in my years to write each of these thousands or even millions of cards But each card confirmed this truth Each was written in my own handwriting Each signed with my signature When I pulled out the file marked Songs I have listened to I realized the files grew to contain their contents The cards were packed tightly and yet after two or three yards I hadnt found the end of the file I shut it shamed not so much by the quality of music but more by the vast time I knew that file represented When I came to a file marked Lustful Thoughts I felt a chill run through my body I pulled the file out only an inch not willing to test its size and drew out a card I shuddered at its detailed content I felt sick to think that such a moment had been recorded An almost animal rage broke on me One thought dominated my mind No one must ever see these cards No one must ever see this room I have to destroy them In insane frenzy I yanked the file out Its size didnt matter now I had to empty it and burn the cards But as I took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor I could not dislodge a single card I became desperate and pulled out a card only to find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it Defeated and utterly helpless I returned the file to its slot Leaning my forehead against the wall I let out a long self-pitying sigh And then I saw it The title bore People I Have Shared the Gospel With The handle was brighter than those around it newer almost unused I pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three inches long fell into my hands I could count the cards it contained on one hand And then the tears came I began to weep Sobs so deep that they hurt They started in my stomach and shook through me I fell on my knees and cried I cried out of shame from the overwhelming shame of it all The rows of file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes No one must ever ever know of this room I must lock it up and hide the key But then as I pushed away the tears I saw Him No please not Him Not here Oh anyone but Jesus I watched helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards I couldnt bear to watch His response And in the moments I could bring myself to look at His face I saw a sorrow deeper than my own He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes Why did He have to read every one Finally He turned and looked at me from across the room He looked at me with pity in His eyes But this was a pity that didnt anger me I dropped my head covered my face with my hands and began to cry again He walked over and put His arm around me He could have said so many things But He didnt say a word He just cried with me Then He got up and walked back to the wall of files Starting at one end of the room He took out a file and one by one began to sign His name over mine on each card No I shouted rushing to Him All I could find to say was No no  as I pulled the card from Him His name shouldnt be on these cards But there it was written in red so rich so dark so alive The name of Jesus covered mine It was written with His blood He gently took the card back He smiled a sad smile and began to sign the cards I dont think Ill ever understand how He did it so quickly but the next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file and walk back to my side He placed His hand on my shoulder and said It is finished I stood up and He led me out of the room There was no lock on its door There were still cards to be written I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me ---Phil 413 For God so loved the world that He gave His only son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life If you feel the same way forward it to as many people as you can so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also My People I shared the gospel with file just got bigger how about yours A Andrew Marwede Private Client Services Donaldson Lufkin  Jenrette Securities Corporation an affiliate of  CREDIT  FIRST  SUISSE  BOSTON 200 West

arrived  safe and sound into Dulles Airport tonight at about 600 It was an interesting flight The airport in Denver was almost spooky it was so empty and quie t No  one was in line for the security check point when I got there so tha t went  fairly quickly just x-ray of my bags and then a chemical test to b e sure  nothing explosive was on them Then I waited 2 12 hours to board t he plane  What happened after we boarded was interesting and thought I wou ld share it with  you The pilotcaptain came on the  loudspeaker after the doors were closed His speech went like this  First  I want to thank you  for being brave enough to fly today The doors are now  closed and we have  no help from the outside for any problems that might occur  inside this pla ne As you could tell when you checked in the government has  made some ch anges to increase security in the airports They have not however  made a ny rules about what happens after those doors close Until they do that  w e have made our own rules and I want to share them with you Once those doo rs  close we only have each other The security has taken care of a threat like  guns with all of the increased scanning etc Then we have the suppo sed bomb If  you have a bomb there is no need to tell me about it or any one else on this  plane you are already in control So for this flight t here are no bombs that  exist on this plane Now the threats that are left are things like plastics  wood knives and other weapons that can be mad e or things like that which can  be used as weapons Here is our plan and o ur rules If someone or several people  stand up and say they are hijacking this plane I want you all to stand up  together Then take whatever you h ave available to you and throw it at them  Throw  it at their faces and h eads so they will have to raise their hands to  protect themselves The ver y best protection you have against knives are the  pillows and blankets Wh oever is close to these people should then try to get a  blanket over their head--then they wont be able to see Once that is done get  them down an d keep them there Do not let them up I will then land the plane at  the c losest place and we WILL take care of them After all there are usually  o nly a few of them and we are 200 strong We will not allow them to take ov er  this plane I find it interesting that the US Constitution begins with  the words  We the people--thats who we are THE people and we will not  be  defeated With that the passengers  on the plane all began to applaud people had tears in their eyes and we began  the trip toward the runway  The  flight attendant then began the safety speech One of the things she s aid is  that we are all so busy and live our lives at such a fast pace She asked that  everyone turn to their neighbors on either side and introduce  themselves tell  each other something about your families and children sh ow pictures whatever  She said for today we consider you family We wil l treat you as such and ask  that you do the same with us Throughout the  flight we learned that for the crew this was their first  flight since Tue sdays tragedies It was a day that everyone leaned on each  other and toge ther everyone was stronger than any one person alone It was quite  an expe rience You can imagine the  feeling when that plane touched down at Dulles and we heard welcome to  Washington Dulles Airport where the local time  is 540 Again the cabin was  filled with applause It has been a  very l ong day and one that I am glad is over I have been constantly reminded  th is day of the ar ticle in JAAMT that Barbara Williams recently wrote where she referenced the tornados in Oklahoma and said something like Do we g et mad  and shake our fists at God in anger No we go on and conquer our f ears and  continue our lives It is my hope that is what we do now Last n ight I saw a  program with college students where one of them said that at  their campus there  are no more hyphenated titles ie African-American  etc everyone is just an  American No one will ever be able to take that  pride away from  us20 Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at httpexplorermsncom

American perspective Dear Friends The following was sent to me by my friend Tamim Ansary Tamim is an Afghani-American writer He is also one of the most brilliant people I know in this life When he writes I read When he talks I listen Here is his take on Afghanistan and the whole mess we are in -Gary Dear Gary and whoever else is on this email thread Ive been hearing a lot of talk about bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Ronn Owens on KGO Talk Radio today allowed that this would mean killing innocent people people who had nothing to do with this atrocity but were at war we have to accept collateral damage What else can we do Minutes later I heard some TV pundit discussing whether we have the belly to do what must be done And I thought about the issues being raised especially hard because I am from Afghanistan and even though Ive lived here for 35 years Ive never lost track of whats going on there So I want to tell anyone who will listen how it all looks from where Im standing I speak as one who hates the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden There is no doubt in my mind that these people were responsible for the atrocity in New York I agree that something must be done about those monsters But the Taliban and Bin Laden are not Afghanistan Theyre not even the government of Afghanistan The Taliban are a cult of ignorant psychotics who took over Afghanistan in 1997 Bin Laden is a political criminal with a plan When you think Taliban think Nazis When you think Bin Laden think Hitler And when you think the people of Afghanistan think the Jews in the concentration camps Its not only that the Afghan people had nothing to do with this atrocity They were the first victims of the perpetrators They would exult if someone would come in there take out the Taliban and clear out the rats nest of international thugs holed up in their country Some say why dont the Afghans rise up and overthrow the Taliban The answer is theyre starved exhausted hurt incapacitated suffering A few years ago the United Nations estimated that there are 500000 disabled orphans in Afghanistan--a country with no economy no food There are millions of widows And the Taliban has been burying these widows alive in mass graves The soil is littered with land mines the farms were all destroyed by the Soviets These are a few of the reasons why the Afghan people have not overthrown the Taliban We come now to the question of bombing Afghanistan back to the Stone Age Trouble is thats been done The Soviets took care of it already Make the Afghans suffer Theyre already suffering Level their houses Done Turn their schools into piles of rubble Done Eradicate their hospitals Done Destroy their infrastructure Cut them off from medicine and health care Too late Someone already did all that New bombs would only stir the rubble of earlier bombs Would they at least get the Taliban Not likely In todays Afghanistan only the Taliban eat only they have the means to move around Theyd slip away and hide Maybe the bombs would get some of those disabled orphans they dont move too fast they dont even have wheelchairs But flying over Kabul and dropping bombs wouldnt really be a strike against the criminals who did this horrific thing Actually it would only be making common cause with the Taliban--by raping once again the people theyve been raping all this time So what else is there What can be done then Let me now speak with true fear and trembling The only way to get Bin Laden is to go in there with ground troops When people speak of having the belly to do what needs to be done theyre thinking in terms of having the belly to kill as many as needed Having the belly to overcome any moral qualms about killing innocent people Lets pull our heads out of the sand Whats actually on the table is Americans dying And not just because some Americans would die fighting their way through Afghanistan to Bin Ladens hideout Its much bigger than that folks Because to get any troops to Afghanistan wed have to go through Pakistan Would they let us Not likely The conquest of Pakistan would have to be first Will other Muslim nations just stand by You see where Im going Were flirting with a world war between Islam and the West And guess what thats Bin Ladens program Thats exactly what he wants Thats why he did this Read his speeches and statements Its all right there He really believes Islam would beat the west It might seem ridiculous but he figures if he can polarize the world into Islam and the West hes got a billion soldiers If the west wreaks a holocaust in those lands thats a billion people with nothing left to lose thats even better from Bin Ladens point of view Hes probably wrong in the end the west would win whatever that would mean but the war would last for years and millions would die not just theirs but ours Who has the belly for that Bin Laden does Anyone else Tamim Ansary Terrorist Attacks on US -
