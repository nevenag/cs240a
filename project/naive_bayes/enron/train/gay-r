Sarah and Jack  i am so happy for all of you  im glad everyone made it home safely and is in good health I got the note from your dad and knew yall had left  Our prayers were with you on your trip    Gay Randall L  Sounds like you had a hectic time getting ready as always  Im glad the trip seems to have worked out well  Would like to hear all about it sometime when you have some time Gay Randall L I do apolegize for not getting back to you sooner  Things have been very strange and busy here  By now im sure you have heard about the dizzying collapse of Enron  As of right now i am still employed but bankruptcy is probably on Monday  Luckily the trading floor will probably be sold to an investment bank so we may continue just as before  Will have to see how it works out And of course Thanksgiving was a very busy time visiting family and such  Katy is doing wonderful  She likes school and wants a dirt bike and a pony for Christmas I really am happy for yall and hope to see pictures of Jack soon  Im sure Kathleen is smiling down on yall  Take care and hope to hear from you soon at least sooner than i get back to you Randy and Katy From Frommelt Brian-WBF001

my dad I must not have given him the pipelinecom address  Anyway Im very sorry to be sending this news so late This month has been a blur On the afternoon of Oct 29th we received the call from our agency that our court date was set for Nov 8th and that we had to leave or Russia on Nov 2nd  I was out of the office less than an hour after getting the call Ive been out of the office since then and Im just getting caught up on email now In those three and a half days we had to scramble to complete some last minute paper work for the region as well as to obtain plane reservations and Visas--not to mention  getting packed  As it was FedEx arrived with the visas just two hours before we left for the airport Our trip went smoothly and we returned on Nov 14th with our son- Jack Oleg Frommelt Hes 13 months old and doing great  Sarah likes being an older sister --except when he gets into her toys I had intended to send you a personal note when we received our court date but in the rush  I just didnt get it done--sorry  Some of our extended family didnt even know until after we were in Russia  I tried to call you the night before we left but the number I had didnt work do you have a new phone number or new area code We traveled to the city of Cheboksary  It is on the Volga river roughly between Nizhniy Novgorod and Kazan  Cheboksary is much less remote than Surgut  Tracy was very concerned about being without bottled water again but it was not a problem  We stayed with a host family and that was an nice experience  However at virtually every point in the trip we thought back to February 1997 and our little group We also knew that Kathleen was with us every step of the way I dont have any digital pics to send yet but Ill try to do that soon I hope you and Katy had a wonderful Thanksgiving  I wish we all lived closer to each other We look forward to talking to you sometime soon Love Brian Tracy Sarah  Jack     Subj   Frommelt Adoption     Date   11201 112511 AM Central Standard Time     From   Jjfrommelt     To rgayectenroncom          Randy     Brian asked me to e-mail you and let you know that he     and Tracy left this morning for Russia to pick up one     year old Jack our wonderful new grandson     He tried to call you but said he must have had the wrong number     Jeff Frommelt     Grandpa -----Original Message-----From Frommelt Brian-WBF001 Sent Friday October 05 2001 1242 PM To Randy Gay Subject RE Some good news Randy Thanks for your thoughts  Im glad you mentioned Kathleen  This whole process has been a stressful one and we have had our doubts from time to time  I suppose that is not surprising given that it is a big decision and there were times in the past when we thought we would never go back  Through it all we have felt that Kathleen was somehow with us and would help guide us to make the right decision  I know her spirit will be with us when we make the trip too Sarah is doing great  She is 5 and a half going on 13  This week she asked me to explain websites to her  She loves Kindergarten and we make lots of trips too the library  She played park district soccer for a few weeks but it wasnt her thing  Shed rather climb and swing at the park or play with her friends Glad to hear the new job responsibilities are going well The trading has to be exciting Ill bet it can be exhausting too  I hope you get some time to yourself to re-charge your batteries  By the way Enron field looks great even when the Astros are pounding my Cubbies  It has been a difficult year at Motorola but the challenges also bring opportunity  Tracy and I doing well We just celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary--Where did the time go We dont know travel or court dates yet --it could take several weeks  Well keep you posted as soon as we have any news Take care Brian -----Original Message-----From Randy Gay mailtopookypipelinecom Sent Thursday October 04 2001 915 PM To Frommelt Brian-WBF001 Subject Re Some good news Brian Tracy and Sarah  that is fantastic news  Katy and I are so happy for you  Sounds like you have a wonderful journey ahead of you  Again  I hope this experience is as good if not better than the last Your news made me think about our time together also  I know Kathleen would be and is im sure so happy for you  The pictures we have of us all from Russia really show what a wonderful time we had together  I treasure those memories as im sure you do How is Sarah  Is she in kindergarten this year  Katy is and loves it  When shes not at school she is playing school  She also loves books which i am very happy about  She is having a very busy social season as well How are you two doing  We always talk about the kids i hope you and Tracy are doing well  I have been following all the news about Motorola in the last year and am sure you are doing well  I have been trading gas in both the physical and futures markets and i love it  I went through two of the three biggest stress inducing times of a persons life a new job is second and seem to have made it through ok  Every day i seem to get a little stronger although i still miss Kathleen every day Please let me know how yall are doing  I am really hoping your travels are good  When do you think you will be going  Is it another winter trip to Siberia  If so dont forget to take all the essentials Write back when you can and let me know how you are doing  Take care and God bless yall Randy and Katy At 0418 PM 1012001 -0500 you wrote  Randy and Katy    We have some good news and we wanted you to be among the first to  know  Tracy and I have accepted a referral for a little boy in  Russia  He is in Cheboksary city on the Volga river about 600 miles East  of Moscow and will be 1 year old on 1017    It took a great deal of thought and prayer  At times we had serious  doubts if it was the right path and wondered if we were crazy to go  through this again but when we received a referralit just felt right    We are using a different agency this time in part because Larissa was not  accredited when we started the process    Weve talked to Sarah about the adoption but we are not making a big deal  about it with her until we get closer to traveling  We dont have travel  or court dates yet but we will definitely keep you posted    The entire process has made us think back on the time we all had in Russia  together and the experiences we shared    All our best to you and Katy    Brian
