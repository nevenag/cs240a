now leave the document alone or theres going to be  trouble    I dont hate the rich  I help the poor  I know wrestling is fake  Ive never owned or was a slave and a large percentage of our  forefathers werent wealthy enough to own one either Please stop  blaming me because some prior white people were idiots - and  remember  tons of white Indian Chinese and other races have been enslaved  too  - it was wrong for every one of them  I believe a self-righteous liberal with a cause is more dangerous than  a  Hells Angel with an attitude  I want to know exactly which church is it where the Reverend Jessie  Jackson preaches and what exactly is his job function  I own a gun you can own a gun and any red blooded American should be  allowed to own a gun but if you use it in a crime then you will  serve  the time    I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and  continue to make more  If it makes you mad then invent the next  operating system thats better and put your name on the building  Ask  your buddy that invented the Internet to help you  I dont believe in hate crime legislation  Even suggesting it makes  me  mad    Youre telling me that someone who is a minority gay disabled  another nationality or otherwise different from the mainstream of  this  country has more value as a human being that I do as a white male  If  someone kills anyone Id say that its a hate crime  We dont need  more laws  Lets enforce the ones we already have    I think turkey bacon turkey beef turkey fake anything sucks  I believe that it doesnt take a village to raise a child-it takes a  parent with the guts to stand up to the kid and spank his butt and say  NO whenits necessary to do so  Ill admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was Ole Yeller I  didnt realize Dr Seuss was a genius until I had a kid    I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made to keep  silent because I have these beliefs and opinions  I thought this  country allowed me that right  I will not conform or compromise just  to keep from hurting somebodys feelings  Im neither angry nor  disenfranchised no matter how desperately the mainstream media would  like the world to believe otherwise    Yes I guess by some peoples definition I may be a bad American  But  thats tough    Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at  httpexplorermsncomintlasp
