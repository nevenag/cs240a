It appears that the 16,000 was extra gas that the terminal overdelivered.  The imbalance is between the terminal and trunkline.  Dan Masters has agreed to take all these imbalances and net them in january 2002.  ENA has no responsibility for this gas and will not allow it to be put on our agreements.  This will only create an imbalance we will be cashed out on.  In January 2002  the price we settle up at will need to be decided at that time.

The sendout for that April 16 delivery on the "Hoegh Galleon" begins on May
1, then is ratable through January 31, 2002 on the rest (5 more) of the
"Hoegh Galleon" cargoes.  I would be in favor of settling up at the end of
January for all 6 cargoes since we'll have overage/underage every month.
Let me know what you think.
Dan

Trunkline just called me to tell me that we received 16,595 mmbtu too much
from LNG in the month of March.   There is another ship due to come in on
April 16th.   Trunkline has suggested that we take 16,595 less then what we
are expecting, in order to make up for the March imbalance.

Tammy-
Following up on the email below, I show that between the two cargoes we
delivered, Enron LNG Marketing will be billing Enron North America for a
total of 5,759,994 MMBtu on our various contracts.  CMS Trunkline delivered
5,776,300 MMBtu of gas through the pipeline, or 16,306 MMBtu excess. This
16,306 MMBtu is to be handled directly between Trunkline and Enron North
America.
Please let me know if you disagree with any of these figures.

Tammy-
I never heard back from Jim O'leary at Trunkline, but just to make sure we
are on the same page I wanted to confirm our quantities for this month.

From the "LNG Jamal" you should get 3,104,896 MMBtu total in March.  Please
have the contract for the last 51,396 MMBtu faxed to me at 713-646-6560.

From the "Matthew" you should get 2,720,000 MMBtu total in March.  This
number is approximate and will change to an exact number after arrival of
the "Matthew" around Mar 10, however I undertand the gas will be delivered
starting March 1 from Trunkline.

After we get the exact figure from the discharge of the "Matthew" I will
send out another email to show the total amount you will receive from us in
March.  Any quantities over or under this amount should be reconciled
between Enron North America and Trunkline.

Thanks and regards,
Dan Masters

I am not sure if they have confirmed either deal.  However, deal #1034254 was never pathed by us, whereas 1027152 was.  Therefore, nothing billed out under 1034254.

Bonnie - I am including you on this note in case you can add anything about the pathing of the two deals mentioned in this note.  Niether CMS orgaination shows anything on Trunkline that matches this.  We spoke briefly about this last week.

Phillip - I am including you in case you can add any clarity or determine who we did this deal(s) with.

Thank you,

Tom,

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

It requires a strong knowledge of the wholesale electricity business, and minimum gas knowledge.  It also requires a solid understanding of options evaluation.  I have traded the options but do not have a strong understanding of the greeks.

Mr. Lay,

Reuters just had an article that said upon closing of the Dynegy deal, you will receive $80,000,000 which buys you out of your employment contract.

Is this true?

If so, since you said in your speech that we are all feeling this pain together, will there be a distribution of the $80,000,000 back to the people who's lives have been crushed and will receive no additional compensation.  It seems unjust that while the people who had nothing to do with the downfall get nothing, the people who were involved in the downfall continue to be well compensated.

I,  as a trader on the gas floor,  am sitting here at my desk still making all attempts to make money for the company, wondering if  I will be getting my next paycheck.  Then I read that you are getting an additional $80,000,000.  I, as well as my fellow employees, feel betrayed once again.  What is the old saying about kicking the dead horse?  The difference is that this horse is still barely breathing and your $80,000,000 just sucked out the final bit of life.

The management level you have been at provides you the inside scoop on all these bad deals and the "pump and dump" that senior management has done to Enron stock over the last years.  It is a disgrace the way you and your senior management have ruined so many peoples lives.  How could you not know that the company would be taking a fall when you signed back on.  Other CEO's coming back into companies under the same situation have accepted no compensation until the company gets back on its feet again.  It seems that you knew what was going to happen, and were able to milk Enron out of another 80 million dollars.

 I have learned a valuable lesson about how business really works.  As an employee, one should milk their company for everything they can get out of it no matter how many people are hurt.  Enron has been a cutthroat stab you in the back organization for a long time.  I always thought it was just my fellow employees doing every thing they could to get ahead.  I never realized that this was the creed that senior management lived by. Senior management must have been in their offices rolling on the floor every time some employee spoke up about trying to make vision and values a success.

You and your teams fine example has changed my life forever.  Aside from the fact that my kids will no longer be going to college, you have changed my thinking for ever.  I will never again believe anything my employers tell me.  I will never again put my company as a top priority.  It is a travesty what you have done to so many peoples lives.

Dear Greg,

I appreciate you coming down to the gas floor and providing us some information about what is going on.

One of the questions that kept getting asked had to do with who will be retained, and what we will be paid when we are retained.  We were told that star performers will be retained.  At what profit level do we become star performers?

I understand you and your staff have a tremendous number of things that need to be accomplished.  As I talk with my peers, the most important thing on our minds is if we will have a job and what we will be paid.  John was saying that in a few months this issue would be addressed.  My immediate concern is to secure employment while there are still positions available with other companies.  I will accept the first lucrative offer that is made to me.  My peers have expressed the same sentiment.  In a few months, there may not be any jobs left.   We have to may hay while the sun shines.  We all have been bombarded with calls from executive search firms.  We are all racing for a limited number of jobs that promise substantially higher salaries.

What we need on this floor is some assurances.  Maybe it should be in the form of granting bonuses now and offering employment contracts.  We need some exact numbers in the form of dates, salaries, and bonus plans. 

Scott Neal brought up this same question several times and John said he understood how critical this situation is.  If there are only trader track personnel left to run this company, will Dynegy still be interested?

Getting a bonus this year that reflects the work I put in is critical.  It is no where near as critical the issue of making sure my children have food on the table.  I do not have two months to wait to find out that the compensation I will be offered ends up being less than what a third party is willing to pay, or the bonus program is a based on a amount to appease me when I may have passed up a percentage deal.

Please sense the urgency that my peers and I are feeling.

I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

Tom,

The below number is for a Duke Energy trader.  So, either this deal is booked wrong or this is not the correct trader name.  Please advise.

Audrey,

You should get Martin Cuilla, Jason Williams, and Jim Simpsons info by Monday.  Andy is still questioning his employment  contract.  He does like the idea of the desk moving together though.  If you do get to the long term traders, Bryant Fryhart is excellent in his area.

Talk to you soon.

Tom Donohoe.

Dear Pastor,

For the last few weeks I have been under all type of excessive work related stress.  I try not to bring any home but this last weekend I was at my wits end and it my family noticed my change.  The more I thought about my situation the more uptight I got.  I didn't know whether to quit or trudge on.

Then came Sunday morning.  I got to my 4 year old class and the troubles were all absent from my mind.  Teaching those kids got my mind off of all the troubles.  I got into the sanctuary and the first words of your sermon, concerning people with problems, were directed right at me.  In a matter of moments I realized I had been trying to deal with these situations on my own, asking no help from the Lord.  In an instant all my stresses were lifted completely.  It is so wonderful the way the Lord works.  He had you plan a sermon that was timed perfectly for the moment I could take the mess at work no longer.

The rest of my day was great!

I came into work this morning and some of the things that were causing stress turned around for the better.

The Lord is great at reminding us who is in charge at all times.

This is not the first time a sermon was perfectly timed.  Just after you joined us, one of your sermons was just what I needed to hear when I was at my wits end.

Thanks for a great sermon and hallelujah to the Lord for watching over his flock.

Sincerely,

Tom Donohoe

Tom,

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

Scott

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

thanks.
