KINDERMAN FOUNDATION  They say 28     people have already died from some type of chemical or something on a     sponge inside         They are taking this seriously at this point  I would hope that     this would hit the news later but they say there are so many things     going on its impossible to cover them all  If you do get an envelope     like this call the police department or take it to your nearest fire     station or back to the post office         Just do not open it         How sad this all is  I guess the best thing is to stick together     protecting caring and sharing

is an old one but a great one If you dont like this email then you just dont understand A chronology of events for Saturday  December 4 1999 and the early morning hours of Sunday December 5 1999 600 Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 620 Get in car drive to New Braunfels 730 Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning 850 Turn 9 crack open first beer 853 Crack open second beer 858 Crack openyou get the idea 1030 Finish 18 holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 1035 Headed for San Antonio 1050 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 1110 We decide we dont have enough booze so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol 750 ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam 1150 Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About 70 degrees 1155 I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 1156 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself 1215 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT 1225 In the post-serenade serendipity 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 100 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 130 I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and 11 cans of beer into my pants 147 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as Cell-Phone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those non-refundable non-transferrable sons-of-bitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix non-refundable and non-transferrable Price 712 He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pre-game kingdom 234 Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy 245 I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas 301 The first quarter mercifully ends 9 yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler 336 Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety 356 Halftime score Nebraska 15 Texas 0 I wish I had another Traveler 411 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused 421 I buy my 2nd and 3rd 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase 5 Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies 451 No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more 5 beers from the Alamodome merchants 518 Score is Nebraska 22 Texas 0 I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field 527 I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable 537 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system 549 Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty 616 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship 630 Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the 800 Texas-Arizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care 712 We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig 717 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care 801 We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truck-mate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon 830 We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly 847 I am rallying I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona 911 Halftime score Texas 31 Arizona 29 I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me 941 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center much less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light 952 I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing 1009 Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off 1015 After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously 1022 I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops 1043 Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving 1059 With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap 1117 I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid fuck 1131 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck 1138 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck 1147 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck 1158 I am jostled The truck is moving I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to Neon Moon 1211 We are moving We are out of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle 1226 We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight 1259 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers 117 The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter Ive been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost 5 years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three Sorry cant let you in We attempt to reason with him He laughs harder 144 We find a bar that lets us in We take two steps in the door and hear Last call for alcohol I turn to the group and mutter See dat wasnt that fuckin hard Day dont fuckin do that at the Awamothe awaomthe alabfuck it that stadium we was at today We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers 215 Back on the street We need food We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katzs The cab fare is 160 We give him 10 and tell him to keep it 217 There is a 20 minute wait We give the hostess 50 We are seated immediately 225 We order two orders of fried pickles a Cobb salad a bowl of soup two orders of Blueberry blintzes two Reuben sandwiches a hamburger two cheese stuffed potatoes an order of fries and an order of onion rings 239 The food arrives We are all asleep with our heads on the table The waiter wakes us up We eat every fucking bit of our food Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted We dont give a shit The tab is 112 with tip 246 Im sleepy 912 I wake up next to a strange woman She is the bartender at Katzs She is not pretty

whose thrillers have sold 60 million copies and been turned into blockbuster movies - the events of Tuesday hold a special poignancy In his best selling novel Debt Of Honor in 1994 he created a scenario chillingly similar to the attacks a Japanese pilot crashes a 747 jet into the US Capitol buildings killing the President and most of his Cabinet Here Clancy explains why the mood of his nation is now turning to revenge It was a friend of mine formerly of the Royal Navy who first pointed out that the casualty count on this incident exceeds that of Pearl Harbor Yes my country has taken a big and costly hit and somewhere perhaps in South Asia some people are exchanging high-fives and having themselves a good laugh And maybe theyre entitled to it Like Pearl Harbor it was a well planned and well executed black operation But you know theyve made the same mistake that Japan made back in 1941 Its remarkable to me that America is so hard for some people to understand We are the most open of books after all Our values and customs are portrayed on TV and movie screens all over the world Is the character of my country so hard to grasp Japan figured that they could defeat us not physically but morally that America was not tough enough to defeat their death-seeking warriors that we would be unwilling to absorb the casualties In this they were right we didnt absorb all the casualties they tried to inflict - but that was because we killed their samurai much more efficiently than they were able to kill our men An enemy willing to die in the performance of his duty can indeed be a formidable adversary but you see weve dealt with such people before They die just like everyone else Perhaps the American sort of patriotism like the British sort just isnt bombastic enough for our enemies to notice We dont parade about thumping our chests and proclaiming how tough we are whereas other people like that sort of display But they dont seem to grasp the fact that they do it because they have to - they evidently need to prove to themselves how formidable they are Instead our people like yours train and practice their craft every day out in the field at places like Fort Bragg North Carolina and Fort Irwin California Ive been to both places and seen our people and how they train The difference between a civilian or a common ruffian and a soldier you see is training A professional soldier is as serious about his work as a surgeon is about his Such people are not in my experience boastful If you ask what they can do they will explain it to you usually in quiet tones because they do not feel the need to prove anything Off duty they are like everyone else watching football on TV and enjoying a quiet beer with their pals They read books shop at the local supermarkets and mow the grass at home They all enjoy a good laugh They make the best of friends They look physically fit - and indeed they are physically fit - because their job requires it and every day they do something tiresome in the field working at some more or less demanding field exercise again and again and again until every aspect of their job is as automatic as zipping ones zipper is for us people in civilian life But you know inside all of these people such as the 82nd Airborne at Fort Bragg or the 75th Ranger Regiment at Fort Stewart Georgia there burns a little flame Not a big one instead like the pilot light in a gas stove And when you put more gas there the flame gets bigger enough to cook with Inside every one of these people is something else something you have to look for - pride They know that they are good at their work in the event they ever have to do it for real This doesnt happen very often and indeed they do not ordinarily lust to do it because its a serious nasty job The job is the taking of life Military organizations exist for only one mission killing people and breaking things This is not something to be undertaken lightly because life is a gift from God and a lot of these people - kids really -can be found in church on Sunday mornings But their larger purpose - the reason these kids enlist both in my country and in yours - is to preserve protect and defend their nations and the citizens who live there Its not an easy job but someone has to do it and typically the hardest jobs attract the best of us Mostly they never have to kill anybody and thats okay with them Its knowing that they are able to do something difficult and dangerous that gives them their pride This purpose defending their country is something they dont talk much about but its always there and with it comes a quiet steely look in the eyes Especially when something like this happens Thats when their sense of self is insulted and these are people who do not bear insults well They are protectors and when those whom they are sworn to protect are hurt then comes the desire - the lust - to perform their mission Even then its quiet They will not riot or pose before TV cameras or cry aloud for action because thats not their way They are the point of the lance the very breath of the dragon and at times like this they want to know the taste of blood Their adversaries just dont appreciate what they are capable of Its something too divorced from their experience This isnt like hosing civilians with your machine-gun or setting off a bomb somewhere or killing unarmed people strapped and helpless inside a commercial aircraft This means facing professional warriors at a time and place of their choosing and that is something terrorists dont really prepare for The day of Pearl Harbor the commander of the Japanese navy told his staff not to exult too much that all their beautifully executed operation had accomplished was to awaken a sleeping dragon and give it a dreadful purpose Perhaps alone in his country Isoroku Yamamoto who had lived briefly in America knew what his enemy was capable of and for that reason perhaps he was not surprised when the 50-caliber bullet from a P-38 fighter entered his head and ended his life Whoever initiated last weeks operation is probably not quite as appreciative of what he has begun as Yamamoto was Because the dragon is now fully awake and its breath is too hot for men to bear America is now fully awake Our quiet patriotism is a little louder now but it will not get too loud Why spoil the surprise Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at httpexplorermsncomintlasp

chronology of events for Saturday  December 4 1999 and the early morning hours of Sunday December 5 1999 600 Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 620 Get in car drive to New Braunfels 730 Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning 850 Turn 9 crack open first beer 853 Crack open second beer 858 Crack openyou get the idea 1030 Finish 18 holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 1035 Headed for San Antonio 1050 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 1110 We decide we dont have enough booze so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol 750 ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam 1150 Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About 70 degrees 1155 I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 1156 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself 1215 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT 1225 In the post-serenade serendipity 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 100 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 130 I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and 11 cans of beer into my pants 147 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as Cell-Phone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those non-refundable non-transferrable sons-of-bitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix non-refundable and non-transferrable Price 712 He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pre-game kingdom 234 Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy 245 I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas 301 The first quarter mercifully ends 9 yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler 336 Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety 356 Halftime score Nebraska 15 Texas 0 I wish I had another Traveler 411 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused 421 I buy my 2nd and 3rd 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase 5 Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies 451 No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more 5 beers from the Alamodome merchants 518 Score is Nebraska 22 Texas 0 I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field 527 I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable 537 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system 549 Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty 616 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship 630 Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the 800 Texas-Arizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care 712 We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig 717 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care 801 We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truck-mate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon 830 We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly 847 I am rallying I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona 911 Halftime score Texas 31 Arizona 29 I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me 941 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center much less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light 952 I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing 1009 Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off 1015 After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously 1022 I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops 1043 Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving 1059 With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap 1117 I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my

truck is moving I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to Neon Moon 1211 We are moving We are out of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle 1226 We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight 1259 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers 117 The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter Ive been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost 5 years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three Sorry cant let you in We attempt to reason with him He laughs harder 144 We find a bar that lets us in We take two steps in the door and hear Last call for alcohol I turn to the group and mutter See dat wasnt that fuckin hard Day dont fuckin do that at the Awamothe awaomthe alabfuck it that stadium we was at today We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers 215 Back on the street We need food We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katzs The cab fare is 160 We give him 10 and tell him to keep it 217 There is a 20 minute wait We give the hostess 50 We are seated immediately 225 We order two orders of fried pickles a Cobb salad a bowl of soup two orders of Blueberry blintzes two Reuben sandwiches a hamburger two cheese stuffed potatoes an order of fries and an order of onion rings 239 The food arrives We are all asleep with our heads on the table The waiter wakes us up We eat every fucking bit of our food

Phone  512-795-8536  Horns Favored by 3 Over Sooners Game at OSU Set for  1130 AM on Fox TV  Texas is favored by three points over Oklahoma for  their 230 pm showdown  in the Cotton Bowl Saturday I was amazed when I  looked at five Las Vegas  lines and saw all of them had the Longhorns as the  favorite Oklahoma is the  defending national champion has a higher ranking  has the nations longest  winning streak and I dont want to even get into how  bad they put it on the  Horns last year  Lets hope the bookies know something I think it  will be a great game and I  think the Longhorns have a great chance to win but  I cant see making the  Horns a pre-game favorite  A big key will be to hang tough early When the  Longhorns won in 1999 they  had to overcome an early 17-0 Oklahoma lead In last  years blowout the  Sooners also jumped out to a big early lead and they  kept on pouring it on  Texas has a big offensive line and a big running  back and the Longhorns  might  be able to wear Oklahomas defense  down if the  Horns can be physical for  four quarters Thats what Kansas State did last  week and the Wildcats came  back from a 35-14 deficit and almost pulled it out  Texas needs to avoid falling behind and then try to  pull away in the late  stages because Oklahoma is pretty thin in the  defensive line The starters  are very good but the backups are untested       Coach Mack Brown a former assistant coach at  Oklahoma had a funny story to  tell at his Monday press conference He said when he  took the job at  Oklahoma he asked Sooner coach Barry Switzer who OU  had to beat to keep the  coaches from getting fired He said Switzer said  Texas He said he asked  about the Big 8 foes such as Nebraska and Switzer  repeated Texas  When he came to Texas as the head coach he said he  asked some of the top  Longhorns who he needed to beat to keep his job  Everybody he said they  replied He said he thought they were joking and  smiled at them but they  didnt smile back       The Longhorns game at Oklahoma State next weekend  will have an 1130 am  kickoff and will be the Fox Syndication Big 12 Game  of the Week If you live  in Texas or Oklahoma and in most other states you  should be able to get the  game but check with your cable company to make  sure       RECRUITING NOTES  Nine of the recruits on my 25-man  difference-maker list  have committed and Texas leads the way with five  pledges The future  Longhorns are  No 4 DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos  No 11 LB Garnett Smith  of Arlington Lamar No 17 LB Brian Robison of  Splendora No 23 OL Brett  Valdez of Brownwood and No 24 QB Billy Don Malone  of Paris North Lamar AM  is next with two pledges from No 10 Athlete Reggie  McNeal of Lufkin and No  20 Athlete LTydrick Riley of Crockett The other  two on the list who are  committed are No 18 Center Bob Morton of McKinney  to Notre Dame and No 25  CB Michael Hawkins of Carrollton Turner to Oklahoma  The Longhorns also have  great shots at No 1 DT Rodrique Wright of Alief  Hastings No 2 QB Vincent  Young of Houston Madison No 3 DE Larry Dibbles of  Lancaster No 6 RB  Albert Hardy of Galena Park No 7 MLB Aaron Harris  of North Mesquite No  13  OL Justin Blalock of Plano East and No 14 DT Marco  Martin of Mesquite They  also have fair shots at No 5 DE Travis Leitko of  The Woodlands No 8  Athlete Edorian McCullolugh of North Garland No 12  TE Eric Winston of  Midland Lee No 19 CB Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur  Lincoln and No 22  Athlete  DaBryan Blanton of Forney That leaves only four of  the 25 who are long  shots  or no shots for the Horns No 9 OLB Marvin Byrdsong  likes Texas but has  some academic issues as does No 21 RB Paul Mosley  of Austin Anderson No  15 Safety Vickiel Vaughn of Plano West has no  interest in Texas The rem  aining difference maker is No 16 WR Robert  Timmons of Flower Mound  Marcus who is interested in the Horns but who has  been in trouble quite a  bit If he avoids suspensions and other trouble for  the rest of the season  and if his coach gives him a strong recommendation  he could wind up getting  an offer But the odds are that he will commit to  another school in the  meantime       My next e-mailfax will be whenever events warrant       The True Orange E-MailFax Service includes  at  least  99 faxe-mails  a  year and costs 99 79 by E-Mail The True Orange  Newsletter includes  26  newsletters and is published weekly during football  season and twice monthly  during most of the other months It costs 45 Save  by subscribing to both  for 130 or 110 if you take the faxes via E-Mail  or 99 if you take both  services via E-Mail Send check  to address at the  top of page I also  update my 900 number -

KINDERMAN FOUNDATION  They say 28     people have already died from some type of chemical or something on a     sponge inside         They are taking this seriously at this point  I would hope that     this would hit the news later but they say there are so many things     going on its impossible to cover them all  If you do get an envelope     like this call the police department or take it to your nearest fire     station or back to the post office         Just do not open it         How sad this all is  I guess the best thing is to stick together     protecting caring and sharing

is an old one but a great one If you dont like this email then you just dont understand A chronology of events for Saturday  December 4 1999 and the early morning hours of Sunday December 5 1999 600 Arise play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 620 Get in car drive to New Braunfels 730 Tee off me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning 850 Turn 9 crack open first beer 853 Crack open second beer 858 Crack openyou get the idea 1030 Finish 18 holes as well as beers sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 1035 Headed for San Antonio 1050 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 1110 We decide we dont have enough booze so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol 750 ml plastic bottle Traveler Jim Beam 1150 Arrive at the tailgate spot Awesome day Not a single cloud in the sky About 70 degrees 1155 I decide that were going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 1156 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself 1215 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Were on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner a couple hundred of us Were hooting and hollering like wildmen The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas AWESOME MOMENT 1225 In the post-serenade serendipity 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 100 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome Again we hoot and holler like wildmen Again the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us this time however with the Nebraska fight songs Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska 130 I begin the walk to the Alamodome somehow managing to stuff the Traveler and 11 cans of beer into my pants 147 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans They are taunting me I am taunting back still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as Cell-Phone Flop Out Remember flop out for a dollar The rules are similar I tell this Nebraska jackass that if hes so confident in his team he should flop out his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl And then I spoke these memorable words And not those damn refundable tickets either You request those non-refundable non-transferrable sons-of-bitches He backs down He is unworthy I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix non-refundable and non-transferrable Price 712 He is humbled He lowers his head in shame I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans I am KING and these are my subjects I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses I RULE the pre-game kingdom 234 Kickoff Brimming with confidence I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy 245 I notice something troubling Nebraska is big Nebraska is fast Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas 301 The first quarter mercifully ends 9 yards total offense for Texas Zero first downs for Texas Im still talking shit I pour another stiffy from the Traveler 336 Four minutes to go in the first half the Traveler is a dead soldier I buy my first 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants While I am standing in line a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone Safety 356 Halftime score Nebraska 15 Texas 0 I wish I had another Traveler 411 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom Hey buddy niiiiiiiiice cock He is unamused 421 I buy my 2nd and 3rd 5 beer from the Alamodome merchants I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me Surprisingly they are equipped with a flask full of vodka I send them off to purchase 5 Sprites so that we may consume their vodka I have not lost faith Nebraska is a bunch of pussies 451 No more vodka The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives I purchase two more 5 beers from the Alamodome merchants 518 Score is Nebraska 22 Texas 0 I am beginning to lose faith This normally would trouble me but I am too drunk to see the football field 527 I call Southwest Airlines Im sorry sir Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable 537 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter As it turns out the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock I am enraged by this policy I ask loudly Why the fuck didnt you announce last call over the fucking PA system 549 Back in my seats I am slumped in my chair in defeat All of a sudden the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts Whazzis I mutter awaking from my coma Iz we winnig Did wez scort Alas the answer is no we were not winning and we did not score The largest by far cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters S K and A in the Nebraska spelled out in their end zone I cheer wildly I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it I am thirsty 616 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage but I am too drunk to form complete sentences With my last cognitive thought of the evening I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October they would be playing Florida State for the national championship 630 Back in the car On the way back to Austin for the 800 Texas-Arizona tip off We can still salvage the day I crack open a beer It is warm I dont care 712 We have stopped for gas I am hungry I go inside the store I walk past the beer frig I notice a Zima Ive never had a Zima I wonder if its any good I pull a Zima from the frig I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows Zima sucks I replace the empty bottle in the frig 717 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store I walk to where the ingredients are where the person usually makes the sub There is no one there I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives I eat them I am still hungry I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami The patrons in the store fear me I dont care 801 We are in South Austin I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour My truck-mate is tired of my singing He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides Youre Going to Miss Me When Im Gone and Neon Moon and that maybe listening to only those two songs ten times each was a bit excessive Perhaps he suggests I could just let the CD play on its own I tell him to fuck off and restart Neon Moon 830 We arrive at the Erwin Center My truckmate against my loud and profane protestations parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage I tell him hes an idiot I tell him we will never get out I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here He ignores me I think hes still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes I whistle Neon Moon loudly 847 I am rallying I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants Were going to kick the shit out of Arizona 911 Halftime score Texas 31 Arizona 29 I am pleased I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do the bathroom Brice There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom I am disappointed I tell myself out loud that I have a Niiiiiice cock No one is amused but me 941 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can Needless to say they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center much less Bud Light out of a can I am stopped by an usher Where did you get that sir I tell him no shit Oh the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs Would you mind throwing this away for me I take the last swig and hand it to him He is confused I pretend Im going to the bathroom but I run away giggling instead I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher who is now pursuing me I sneak into a large group of people and sit down The usher walks by harmlessly I am giggling like a little girl I crack open another can of Bud Light 952 I am lost In my haste to avoid the usher I have lost my bearings I have no ticket stub I cannot find my seats Texas is losing 1009 Texas is being screwed by the refs I am enraged I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it A concerned fan asks if Im OK and perhaps I shouldnt take it so seriously I tell him to fuck off 1015 After the fourth consecutive worst fucking call I have EVER seen I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects However on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt Perhaps I think to myself Im taking this a bit seriously 1022 I am standing in the bathroom peeing Im so drunk I am swaying and grunting I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye My pants are bloody I have my formerly white shirt wrapped around my waist I look like I should be in an episode of Cops 1043 Texas has lost I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritancopsecurity guard to ask me why I am covered in blood but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving 1059 With my one good eye I have located the parking garage I walk up six flights of stairs promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs find the truck and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I take a nap 1117 I awake from my nap I see my friend in the drivers seat I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I am too tired to punch my friend I call my friend a Stupid fuck 1131 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck 1138 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck 1147 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage six whole flights and no one is moving I call my friend a Stupid fuck 1158 I am jostled The truck is moving I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor I jump out of the truck walk to the edge of the parking facility and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to Neon Moon 1211 We are moving We are out of beer I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers I am happy I return to my vehicle 1226 We have emerged from the parking facility We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him We are all going to die tonight 1259 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsthers Ed has to pee He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall smashing it into hundreds of pieces We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsthers 117 The PollyEsthers doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club Fellas he says in between his fits of spastic laughter Ive been working this door for almost a year Ive been working doors in this town for almost 5 years And I can honestly say that I aint never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three Sorry cant let you in We attempt to reason with him He laughs harder 144 We find a bar that lets us in We take two steps in the door and hear Last call for alcohol I turn to the group and mutter See dat wasnt that fuckin hard Day dont fuckin do that at the Awamothe awaomthe alabfuck it that stadium we was at today We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers 215 Back on the street We need food We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katzs The cab fare is 160 We give him 10 and tell him to keep it 217 There is a 20 minute wait We give the hostess 50 We are seated immediately 225 We order two orders of fried pickles a Cobb salad a bowl of soup two orders of Blueberry blintzes two Reuben sandwiches a hamburger two cheese stuffed potatoes an order of fries and an order of onion rings 239 The food arrives We are all asleep with our heads on the table The waiter wakes us up We eat every fucking bit of our food Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted We dont give a shit The tab is 112 with tip 246 Im sleepy 912 I wake up next to a strange woman She is the bartender at Katzs She is not pretty
