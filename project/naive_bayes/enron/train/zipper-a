Small issue but annoying:

If try to modify a plo by going to the line and getting the +/- box in the row with the order there is no way to change your mind and not modify without two error messages getting generated. i.e. if you decide to leave the price unchanged and hit "set" it generates the error messages, there is no other way to get out of the window though, no x box to close it.

Hope all is well otherwise,

Andy

Harry's comments. He has a valid point on the volumetric suspension issue....i think he will launch the product but ask us to put this in the development queue.

Savita

In our testing we have found the inability to manage our wing-strikes risk.  The way it works for power markets is that most traders would be unwillling to trade more than 250MW of a wing strike without widening out the bid offer.  Similarly the risk at some point can get high enough to suspend wing strikes. In the current option manager, the only possibility is to increase or decrease the ATM suite vol (which has little effect on the wing strikes anyway).


For that reason we need a volumetric control for each strike. The volumeteric control could be a toggle which could be turned on or off. If the volumetric control toggle si on, corresponding to each strike, there would be  a maximum volume.  If  the strike is hit or lifted by that volume, that strike is automatically suspended and the trader notified. This allows the individual strike risk to be limited.  This also allows us to put some less liquid markets out there - where the price discovery is evolving. In those products we can put the volume to be limited at 100 MW for each strike making the risk more manageable.

Pls give me a call, so that we can discuss this further.

I agree.

This is consistent with the e-mail I sent recently and our conversation on the way to Zydako. I assume Webb is for it?  If he is, then it is a strategic decision.

I assume it is also a prelude to daily auctions on structured derivatives and shaped products.

Thanks.

Subject:	Deal Bench and EnronOnline


Greg and Philippe

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.


Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
AZ

We appreciate the effort that HoustonStreet has made to upgrade its system, however in our view insufficient progress has been made to change our decision to terminate the Posting Agreement. Once again, thank you the effort your team put in and let's stay touch.

Jorg,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but you know how things are. I have tried to get someone in the NPC to talk to me but to no avail. I will keep trying but don't hold out much chance...

A big Mazel Tov on the engagement ! Married life is the way to go. 

I heard about Sonny. Oh well...i didn't really know him that well so i can't say if that was a loss or not.

I heard Alex is now with Allegheny Power, although I assume that is in NYC not Hagerstown, MD.

Take care and give me a call...(713) 853 6994

We will only be able to get Kiodex the customers EOL trades as per the agreement. If the customer so desire they can ask us to send their non-EOl trades to Kiodex for processing, but that is outside the Kiodex/ENW agreement.

Rick,

I've been thinking about this. I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For John Arnold's book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it. 

For the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:

Average tenor: 5 months

Average trades per day: 400

average volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu

average px: $2.7/mmbtu

With 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7

You then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.

That takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).

The next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.

As a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?

Andy

Screaming Japanese Schoolgirls Overturn Greenspan's Bus
TOKYO- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan described himself as "shaken but all right" Monday following an incident in which several thousand excited young Japanese fans mobbed and tipped over his tour bus after a speech at the Tokyo Dome. "Mr. Greenspan is at the height of his popularity in Japan right now," said Martine Engers, a publicist for the chairman, who is currently in the midst of a 41-city world tour. "And I guess we simply weren't prepared for this level of fan hysteria." Before military police restored order, thousands of frantically speculating youths drove the Nikkei average past 16,000.

Andy:
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier this morning.  Like I said, I just wanted to introduce myself and see who you might know that would have an interest in ice fishing.  Please feel free to contact me personally or you may also pass my information along to anyone that may have an interest.
 
My client holds a strong position in the Northeast.  They are looking to fill a Senior Gas Trading position.  They are fairly new to the gas world and seeks a professional with a solid understanding of the technical side of natural gas trading.  Somebody that is not afraid of taking "responsible" risks.  
 
Further information includes:  35,000 megawatts of generation, VAR limit of 25 million
 
The role in general would consist of approximately 35% Strategic Gas Hedging in the Northeast with the remaining balance Spec Trading.  This is a Senior Level position so my client is looking for experience as head of a desk.
 
If you have any questions or would like to talk further, please feel free to contact me via phone or email.
 
Thanks,

receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess
parachute payment," according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days. 
  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;

John,

We are sending our bid and offer prices to Reuters for most US Gas & Power products, as well as European Gas and Power, Crude and Refined products, Bandwidth, Coal, Emissions, Weather and Sea Freight.

We will receive 75% of all revenue Reuters collects from subscriptions to EnronOnline quotes. It is an evergreen 1 yr contract with mutual termination rights upon 90 days prior notice. We are under no obligations to provide levels of service.

Revenue expectations:

Reuters will charge, initially, $150/month/desktop. They have 5,000 Energy desktops worldwide.

thus with 100% penetration we would get 5,000 x 150 x 12 x .75= $6,750,000;

With a more realistic assumption of 50% penetration the yield to Enron would be $3,375,000 p.a.

This revenue does not include the incremental benefits, in our view, of branding and standardization of our product and liquidity in the marketplace. In the future I could see us adding a transactable API to the product through Reuters, which would enhance the ease of transaction by Reuters users.

If you have any more questions give me a call or drop me a line.

Yes, but the other shoe is that we should shut down the rest of DealBench. If not, we will need to make large costly changes to the infrastructure to keep it going.

After some preliminary analysis, it does not look like our big counterparties i.e. Dynegy, Rliant, Duke, El Paso etc., are closing down their positions. On the contrary their net positions seem to be rising. This is only for NYMEX related financial instruments, I haven't looked at phys or power yet.

Just thought you would like to know.

I am attending the Bonanza Pilot Proficiency Program (BPPP) clinic at Adams Field in Little Rock. This is the big airport in Little Rock. The clinic will be run at Central Flying Service, phone number there is 800-888-5387. If you need to speak with someone from the clinic ask for Kathy Tatalovich who is the administrator. I will be staying at the Embassy Suites by the airport. I don't have the nuber now but I will call you with it. 

I'll call you from the road.

Love you and the kids mucho,
KPD

"Attention Taliban! You are condemned. Did you know that? The instant the terrorists you support took over our planes, you sentenced yourselves to death. The Armed Forces of the United States are here to seek justice for our dead. Highly trained soldiers are coming to shut down once and for all Osama bin Laden's ring of terrorism, and the Taliban that supports them and their actions. 
"Our forces are armed with state of the art military equipment. What are you using, obsolete and ineffective weaponry? Our helicopters will rain fire down upon your camps before you detect them on your radar. Our bombs are so accurate we can drop them right through your windows. Our infantry is trained for any climate and terrain on earth. United States soldiers fire with superior marksmanship and are armed with superior weapons. 
"You have only one choice ... Surrender now and we will give you a second chance. We will let you live. If you surrender no harm will come to you. When you decide to surrender, approach United States forces with your hands in the air. Sling your weapon across your back muzzle towards the ground. Remove your magazine and expel any rounds. Doing this is your only chance of survival."

There are 2 sheets in the following attachment that contain Enron transactional data for the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Dynegy Direct, labeled as follows:
"Enron Activity - Dynegy Direct"
"Enron Activity - ICE"

  

Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Arkansas joke:


Guy is driving down a rural road in Arkansas.

Cop pulls him over and asks, "got any ID" ?

Guy replies: "'bout what" ?


nother one:
The toothbrush must have been invented in Arkansas. Otherwise it would have been called the "teethbrush" .

Naveen,

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,
Andy

Kenny, Peggy, Mike,

We would definitely like to get this finished by end of June. We can move as fast as you need us to. Ideally I would like both sides to get together early next to hash out any differences. How does this work for you guys ?

Thanks
AZ

Justin,
The traders are free to use any platform they like. I do not approve or disapprove; they are in the best position to make that decision. It is EWS policy however that someone from Amita/Lara's group be the master user to montor activity and control what access agreements we accept.

Thanks,
Andy

Dave,
This is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of Close of business Oct. 15, 2001. Our Treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore. So for getting the term structure of Enron's funding costs for 10/15/01 I probably can't deliver that today. I still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that. I will keep trying though.

Andy Zipper

Subject:	Reuters on NYMEX

Andy,

Unfortunately, the only stick we have in this game is increasing the total number of subscriptions to a price point whereby NYMEX passes.

We may as well capitalize on this because:
We can't not sell them terminals (Access will be available if the floor traders want it--  IF THEY WANT IT, THEY WILL GET IT.)
The large spread traders already know where ENE is at
Our competitors have been playing the EnronOnline/ floor arbitrage game since day one (it was part on our success)

REUTERS ABILITIES:

1.	Reuters has the right to limit "wall board" availability; NYMEX has the right to buy terminals from Reuters
2.	Reuters will request "consistency"; in regards to pricing, re-distribution, etc
3.	Do not have the capability of breaking up the data set

OPINION:

Sell it.  25K per month.  Unlimited enterprise license.

Vin,

Glad we could hook up yesterday. 

The gist of what we are interested in is providing EnronOnline's liquidity to local NYMEX traders. I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between Enron and these locals. EnronOnline's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants. Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with Enron. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper
Vice President
Enron Corp.

Dave,

I am being told that the books and records of Enron's trading units are on aggregate marked off of a cost of funds curve. I should have that curve to you first thing Monday morning. Sorry about the delay but it is hard to get certain things done in a timely fashion around here right now.

Dave,
This is the interest rate curve we used to value our book as of Close of business Oct. 15, 2001. Our Treasury guys are either not available now or are not working anymore. So for getting the term structure of Enron's funding costs for 10/15/01 I probably can't deliver that today. I still think your money desks and corporate traders could give you a pretty realistic picture of that. I will keep trying though.

I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to pay for it.

2). He stated that charging commssion is not a denfensible business model. They will try to make their money through mid and back office services.

3). Their purchase of the IPE is directly related to implementing 2). his vision is to use the IPE infrastrucutre to make all derivative trades cleared and then use the FCM's to fulfill the back office movemment of funds tasks. In a nutshell he beleives the FCM's are all interconnected and used to moving money around for settlements and margins through the clearinghouse, so why not expand their role.

4). When I expressed some skepticism about 3). he asked if we would like to participate in a forum with other ICE members to discuss shared mid and back ofice services. I told him we would.

If anyone has any questions about this let me know.

I am attaching a copy of my resume for you to review. I would appreciate

improve my chances of finding a job.

Thanks,

Gentlemen:

	Here is a revised draft of the Co-Marketing Agreement.  This is not
final and should not be released to Kiodex.  This is an internal draft for
our review.  We can send it along tomorrow, after Travis and I finish
addressing the open issues, which are:

	1.	How should we describe the Change of Control exception for
Warburg, in light of the term sheet that gives Warburg rights to future
financing.  Should we stick with the single transaction?

	2.	We need to confirm the response time in Section 6.6(d).
Kiodex wants to change 0.25 sec to 2 or 3 sec.

	3.	We need to confirm what information will be included in the
Enron Transaction Data, and which data Kiodex will have to extract or add.

	4.	I deleted the termination right in Section 8.3(k) on the
assumption that we are going to a concurrent closing.

	5.	I would like to confirm that the definition of the Kiodex
Application is okay.  I made that up, and no one has ever commented on it.

	There may be some other minor points, but I think that this is most
of it.

	Travis, I will call you tomorrow afternoon.

	Best regards,

	Ted

Jay that makes sense and is the right solution, however I floated it by Rob Benson and Dana Davis and they felt that having to have another product up on the ir screen would but just TOO much. Go figure. So they agreed to let me auto hedge to the base product and 5 min qty 5 increment works for me so we will run with that for the meantime. The non web visible route is my back up.

I'll let you know how it goes.

Thanks
Andy

John,
On the first note: OK, thanks.

On the second, I would like the senior person on each team (and they know who they are) to figure how to divvy up the tasks based upon their teams relative skills. You guys need to figure it out, with my help. Right now we are a little heavily staffed for what we are doing and I am trying to find ways to cope with that. This is one. Your cooperation is appreciated.

Thanks,
AZ

Claudio,

I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how, but it will very definitely be options focused. I think the three major drivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather. I am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather. One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point. What are your views and what would you focus on if you were me ?

Thanks
Andy

Guys,
Let's get together today to dicuss demo. I would like to demo full capability, including option manager. I think it is very important to also set up an interest rate product, perhaps a swap that is quoted in rate only. No need to convert to dollar ox just yet. Given that the guy who is building their commercial paper platform will be there and seems to be one of the main judges of the merit of EOL I think it behooves us to slant presentation that way.

I'm good from 11:00 to 1:00

Andy

John,
Thanks for the note. Yeah things look pretty lousy here at the big E. From first to worst in 4 easy weeks. The untold story is how much money the gas and power trading folks have made that some weenies in three piece in suits in Corp pissed away. Looks like we are going to be bought by Dynegy. Hang in there with ONE. I am agitating for a Christmas visit to Mich by us, so hope to see you then.

Keep on it,
Andy

Who did it?     Foreign Report presents an alternative view 

Israel's military intelligence service, Aman, suspects that Iraq is the 
state that sponsored the suicide attacks on the New York Trade Center and 
the Pentagon in Washington. Directing the mission, Aman officers believe, 
were two of the world's foremost terrorist masterminds: the Lebanese Imad 
Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas operations for Hizbullah, and the 
Egyptian Dr Ayman Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible 
successor of the ailing Osama Bin Laden. 

The two men have not been seen for some time. Mughniyeh is probably the 
world's most wanted outlaw. Unconfirmed reports in Beirut say he has 
undergone plastic surgery and is unrecognisable. Zawahiri is thought to be 
based in Egypt. He could be Bin Laden's chief representative outside 
Afghanistan. 

The Iraqis, who for several years paid smaller groups to do their dirty 
work, were quick to discover the advantages of Al-Qaeda. The Israeli sources

claim that for the past two years Iraqi intelligence officers were shuttling

between Baghdad and Afghanistan, meeting with Ayman Al Zawahiri. According 
to the sources, one of the Iraqi intelligence officers, Salah Suleiman, was 
captured last October by the Pakistanis near the border with Afghanistan. 
The Iraqis are also reported to have established strong ties with Imad 
Mughniyeh. 

"We've only got scraps of information, not the full picture," admits one 
intelligence source, "but it was good enough for us to send a warning six 
weeks ago to our allies that an unprecedented massive terror attack was 
expected. One of our indications suggested that Imad Mughniyeh met with some

of his dormant agents on secret trips to Germany. We believe that the 
operational brains behind the New-York attack were Mughniyeh and Zawahiri, 
who were probably financed and got some logistical support from the Iraqi 
Intelligence Service (SSO)." 

Mughniyeh was the only one believed to have tried it before. On April 12th 
1997, he was reported to be only two hours away from achieving the highest 
goal of any terrorist organisation (until last week): blowing up an Israeli 
El-Al airliner above Tel Aviv. A man carrying a forged British passport with

the name Andrew Jonathan Neumann was in a Jerusalem hotel preparing a bomb 
he was supposed to take on board an El-Al flight leaving Israel, when it 
accidentally went off. Andrew Jonathan Neumann was very badly injured but 
strong enough to reveal later to the Israelis that he was not British but 
Lebanese, and that his operation was supposed to be a special "gift" to 
Israel from Imad Mughniyeh. 

'A psychopath' 

"Bin Laden is a schoolboy in comparison with Mughniyeh," says an Israeli who

knows Mughniyeh . "The guy is a genius, someone who refined the art of 
terrorism to its utmost level. We studied him and reached the conclusion 
that he is a clinical psychopath motivated by uncontrollable psychological 
reasons, which we have given up trying to understand. The killing of his two

brothers by the Americans only inflamed his strong motivation." 

Experts on Iraq and Saddam Hussein also believe that Iraq was the state 
behind the two terror masterminds. "In recent months, there was a change, 
and Iraq decided to get into the terror business. On July 7th, they tried 
for the first time to send a suicide bomber, trained in Baghdad, to blow up 
Tel Aviv airport (Foreign Report No. 2651)." 

Our sources believe that it will be very difficult to get to the bottom of 
this unprecedented terror operation. However, they believe the chief of the 
Iraqi SSO is Qusai Hussein, the dictator's son, and his organisation is the 
most likely to have been involved. 

Mughniyeh, 48, is a "sick man", says an intelligence officer who was in 
charge of his file. He is considered by Western intelligence agencies as the

most dangerous active terrorist today. He is wanted by several governments 
and the Americans have put a $2m reward on his head. 

[Detailed list of Mughniyeh operations removed for Non-Subscriber Extract] 

It was the assassination of one man in March 1984 that is said to have made 
Mughniyeh the CIA's most wanted terrorist. Mughniyeh allegedly kidnapped the

head of the CIA station in Beirut, William Buckley. The kidnapping triggered

what later became known as 'Irangate', when the Americans tried to exchange 
Buckley (and others) with arms for Iran. However, the attempt ended in a 
fiasco. By one unconfirmed account, Mughniyeh tortured and killed Buckley 
with his own hands. 

A year later, in a combined CIA/Mossad operation, a powerful car bomb went 
off at the entrance to the house of Hizbullah's spiritual leader, Sheikh 
Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah. Seventy-five people were killed. One of them was

his brother. Hunted by the CIA and the Mossad, Mughniyeh hid in Iran. 

In February 1992, Israeli helicopter gunships attacked the convoy of the 
then head of Hizbullah, Sheikh Abas Musawi, in South Lebanon. Musawi, his 
wife and children were killed and the revenge attack followed a month later.

According to press reports, Mughniyeh was called back into action and, in a 
well-planned and devastating attack, his people blew up the Israeli embassy 
in Argentina. The building was demolished and 92 were killed. Only last 
year, after a long investigation, did Argentina issue a warrant for 
Mughniyeh's arrest. 

The reprisal for the attack in Argentina came in December 1994, when a car 
bomb went off in a southern Shi'ite suburb of Beirut. Four people were 
killed. One of them was called Mughniyeh, but to the deep disappointment of 
those Israelis who planted the bomb it was the wrong one. Mughniyeh's life 
was saved, but his other brother Fuad was killed. Mughniyeh waited for his 
opportunity for revenge. 

Our Israeli sources claim to see Mughniyeh's signature on the wreckage in 
New York and Washington. How to counter this kind of terrorism? "To fight 
these bastards you don't need a military attack," said an experienced 
Israeli commando officer. "You only need to adopt Israel's assassination 
policy." 

Some interesting facts and info... 

Subject: What's the Plan -- Patterns of Global 
Terrorism 2000 


Hello friends, 

For those of you who I have not spoken to I hope with 
all my heart family and friends are safe.  The victims 
will not be forgotten.  

I would like to engage all of you in a discussion of 
what is to come.  Or perhaps I'm ranting you decide... 

My first reactions like many others were decimation, 
selected occupation, no more standing military, slowly 
over the course of 30-50 years we bring these nations 
into the fold of economic prosperity.  This has worked 
before, but will it now?  On terrorism and 
intelligence, I think terrorism is not to be treated 
as criminal law; we cannot follow the diplomatic code 
when dealing with terrorist organizations (i.e., our 
intelligence should be permitted to assassinate these 
people, or have moles on the payroll). 

After a few days of kill 'em all mentality, I decided 
to begin my education in this matter.  I would like to 
share with you my first research and some impressions. 
 I do feel more informed.  My resolve is no different; 
but my initial general blood thirst is evolving into 
something far more calculated. 

Domestic and international terrorism has been a 
horrible problem for as long as most nations can 
remember.  There is on average more than one terrorist 
event a day in the world.  In the late 1980's it was 
as high as 2 events a day. 
This is terrorism.  From Colin Powell himself.  I 
found myself numb before I event got through the first 
months of 2000.

List of major terrorist organizations - they will all 
need to be eliminated but I have highlighted the first 
targets. 
http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/tgpndx.htm#2000
<http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/tgpndx.htm#2000>  
Start with Al Quida a focal point or umbrella 
organization for a worldwide network that includes 
many Sunni Islamic extremist groups such as Egyptian 
Islamic Jihad, some members of al-Gama'at 
al-Islamiyya, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and 
the Harakat ul-Mujahidin. 

Al-Qaida - an terrorist organization almost run by bin 
Laden, financially his network is like a holding 
company.  Al Quida exerts heavy influence over the 
four organizations listed below.  Each of the other 
organizations in turn exerts influence over other 
terrorist groups.  Most of these are fundamental 
Islamic extremist organizations.  A fear is that a 
general cohesive theme is to overthrow the 
middle-eastern governments, establish fundamentalist 
Islamic states which would persecute other religious 
observers within their borders, wage war on western 
influence internally,  and potentially engage in 
military actions against the United States and other 
western nations. 
http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/qaida.htm
<http://web.nps.navy.mil/~library/tgp/qaida.htm>  

These organizations have signed a fatwa issued by bin 
Laden in 1998 calling for the death of Americans.

Geography - very good idea to look at maps of the 
region. 
http://www.randmcnally.com <http://www.randmcnally.com>  
I found the geography interesting to study in detail. 
Afghanistan is horribly difficult to access.  The 
ocean-to-land access is through Pakistan's Arabian Sea 
coast; then head North 800 miles, to Peshawar and then 
into Kabul (the mountainous route the British used in 
1946).  The Pakistan army is 50% Taliban sympathetic. 
Already 42 political parties have issued statements of 
opposition to their own government for offering to 
help America.  They will descend into civil war most 
surely.  The HUM will likely be a significant part of 
that problem.  It will do us no good to partner with a 
cooperative government and an uncooperative military. 
Could American planes be shot down over Pakistan by 
renegades within their own army?  

Things we should know: 
In Pakistan, many Afghan refugees were initially 
trained by the US and Pakistan Intelligence (ISI) in 
the 1980's to fight the Soviets.  They were called the 
Mujahideen.  Many were children living in refugee 
camps when recruited, having known nothing else in 
this world.  Left to their own devices for 10 years, 
these camps and training centers have given root to 
terrorist organizations (HUM) and violently 
anti-humanitarian fundamentalist movements (the 
Taliban).  The Taliban gained control of Afghanistan 
in 1996 overthrowing the then Shiite-Communist regime, 
killing and hanging the president in downtown Kabul 
for several days.  The Taliban are Sunni Muslim 
fundamentalists and conduct a religious proletariat; 
they terrorize other Muslim communities, the Hazaras 
and Hindu Kush people within their borders.    The 
Taliban recently issued an edict requiring Afghan 
Hindus to wear identifications tags.  Sound familiar? 
The Taliban is hosting Al Qaida, bin Laden's 
organization.   bin Laden also influences the 
fundamentalist (IMU) in Uzbekistan.  The IMU is 
another Sunni fundamentalist terrorist group - they 
are mostly involved in terrorizing Uzbekistan, 
Kyrgyzistan, and Tajikistan, north of Afghanistan. 
The Taliban constituents are predominantly from the 
Pushtun region.  Pushtun covers parts of Afghanistan 
and Pakistan.; There have been movements to create a 
separate Pushtunistan.  This map indicates the ethnic 
breakdown in the region. 
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/pakistan_ethnic_80.jpg>
. 
 And the HUM focuses their attacks on India. 

The Shi'ite Muslims, many other Sunni Muslims, and in 
general the world muslim community do not agree with 
the Taliban's interpretation of Islamic law.  The 
Taliban is not accepted by most of the Islamic world 
because of their extreme harshness and treatment of 
women, total eliminations of all modern culture, and 
being the worlds largest heroin production.  The 
elimination of western influence is not considered a 
problem within some other fundamentalist groups. 

Afghanistan is not friendly with neighbor Iran to it's 
West.  Iran is an Shi'a or Shi'ite Muslim nation. 
Because Iran is predominantly Shi'a; they are 
unfriendly with the more radical Sunni dominated 
Afghanistan.  Iran backs the ousted government and is 
angered by Taliban terrorism and slaughtering of 
thousands of Shi'a Muslims, including Iranian 
diplomats in Afghanistan.  Iran also has border 
disputes with Iraq further to the West even after a 
devastating 8 year war.  Afghanistan and Iraq are both 
25 million people; Iran is closer to 65 million.  
An exchange from 1998 regarding Iran and Afghanistan.

<http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/ops/war/1998/09/980910-afghan2.htm>  

Also during the war with Soviet over 10 MILLION land 
mines were dropped in Afghanistan with no maps left 
behind.  
http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/
<http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/>  

The only opposition to the Taliban is the Northern 
Military Alliance.  These people are also Sunni Muslim 
and ethnically are the Tajiks.  Their leader Massoud 
was killed last week, assassinated by men posing as 
the press.  The sliver of Afghanistan they still 
control is the finger squeezed between northern 
Pakistan and Southern Tajikistan and touching China. 
The Tajik presence cannot be eliminated by the Taliban 
without initiating conflict with Tajikistan.  The NMA 
is a political authority that may be put in place. 
They have offered 15000 soldiers, and 15000 more on 
reserve.  Their leader was killed last week, most 
likely in some coordinated effort - along with the new 
requirement that all organization in Afghanistan need 
to put monies in to the Afghan bank.  Many acts were 
clearly coordinated in this event. 

I have also been seeking out information on the 
Taliban in particular.  These link contain some very 
powerful information.  Quite frankly it is shameful 
that the Western world turned their back when this 
hellish situation was brought on upon Afghanistan many 
years ago. 

First a super high level overview - it is interesting 
to note how many times this land has been ravaged by 
invaders.

Try to digest this information - it is very important 
that initiate an informed dialogue.  But the Taliban 
must go. 

This section is organized geographically based on the 
waterways. 
The nations in question will need to eradicate, expel 
extremists from within their own borders.  This means 
partnering with a United States led coalition and 
contributing emphatically. 

Look at the Mediterranean coast. 
The South - Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Egypt are all 
plagued by terrorism. 
The East - Israel, Lebanon, Syria  all plagued by 
terrorist groups.  There is a dreadful rooting of 
terrorist organization.  Beirut was once a beautiful 
city I am told; For 20 years it has replaced Warsaw as 
the pop-culture reference to a war torn city. 
Terrorism surrounding Israel ties into several other 
organizations including Hizbollah and HAMAS. 

Look at the Red Sea. 
Egypt,Sudan and Saudi Arabia.  The Sudan is terribly 
infiltrated; this may be the terrorist plan hatching 
ground and safe haven.  And while the Saudi's are 
economically partnered with the western world, many 
extremists operating out of Saudi do fund these 
organizations.  Sudan is also suspected of being a 
meeting ground for the terrorist network.  

Look at the Gulf of Aden - entrance to the Red Sea 
Yemen - has allowed bin Laden to broadcast, site of 
the USS Cole bombing.  After the attack, the 
perpetrators fled from Yemen to Afghanistan. 

Rounding the corner into the Persian Gulf. 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - both 
acknowledge the Taliban government.  They have 
provided radical nationals to the Afghans, throughout 
the years, many support the Taliban; some trained with 
bin Laden.  We hope these governments have a change of 
heart with regard to recognition of the Taliban. 
Iran, Persia until 1935, has coastal territory along 
the gulf and the Caspian sea to the north.  We have 
had problems with Iran in the past; in the current 
situation, they may be helpful maybe not.  There is 
information pointing to an Islamic conference in 
Tehran which is another possible "hatching" ground for 
these operations.  Iran still may be a very serious 
issue in the future.  It is a religious government - 
something we all implicitly abhor in this nation. 
They exiled the Shah and began systematically 
eliminating western influence from their society after 
the event in 1979 
Iraq - Part of the Ottoman empire through 1932. 
Kurdish territory in the North bordering on Turkey. 
Hussein has used Sarin nerve gas against his own 
nationals, the Kurds in the North near the Turkish 
border.  As we know, he has invaded Kuwait.  An 8 year 
war with Iran over borders was going on at the same 
time the soviets were in Afghanistan.  This is a 
military regime.  Though the economic sanctions we 
have used for the last 10 years have kept Iraq down as 
military force; they have created a new generation of 
hatred. 

East from the Gulf into the Arabian Sea, part of the 
Indian Ocean, the Arabian basin is separated from the 
Indian Ocean by underwater land structure but there is 
nothing to prevent sea travel. 
Pakistan - a country on the verge of civil war.  A 
military regime. Probably half of the people in the 
army are Taliban sympathizers.  Pakistan may be in 
civil war shortly. 
India - the largest democracy in the world.  Still 
disassembling the 3500 yr old Caste System.  The 
British occupation left India with an intact system of 
representative government.  They are plagued by 
internal strife from the Sikh, who are separatists. 
Their brand of terrorism has been significantly 
reduced in the past 8 years.  They are also plagued by 
the HUM another extremist fundamental Islamic movement 
- very closely connected to the Taliban and bin Laden 
as described earlier. 

China actually shares a thin strip of border with 
Afghanistan near Tajikistan.  Pakistan also borders on 
China.  Though the Himalayas separate the bulk of this 
geographically from the 1 billion people of China. 
Having China on board is critical. 

I would like the US to investigate TSI, Telephone 
Services International, a New Jersey Corporation and 
Unocal, a California Oil Company.  Both of these 
companies have had business dealings with the Taliban 
government.  I believe that corporate greed with total 
disregard for the human condition in any country is 
unacceptable and should be uncovered and dealt with 
accordingly.  And I think the investment community 
needs to demonstrate in the markets to corporations 
who dabble in business with terror linked 
organizations.  The investment community was hit 
particularly hard; i hope going forward there will be 
a clear message to stop support for companies who may 
potentially aggravate terrorists to attack Americans. 
We may need to legally restrict what our corporations 
can do abroad and who they are allowed to strike deals 
with based on the opportunity cost of potential 
terrorist activity.  By all means, no corporation 
should have had any business dealings with the 
Taliban; perhaps this should be enforced by law. 

Some rants about waking the sleeping giant MIND! 
I firmly believe that the deadened state of 
intellectual discussion concerning these issues in 
America is part of the problem. 
We have been funneling our best minds into Technology, 
Banking, Law and Medicine for a very long time.  The 
general lack of information and interest in world 
political and human conditions, and the evolution of 
human governments is dangerous.  The average American 
simply need to be more informed and have an opinion to 
express to our government on what we can do to ensure 
the survival of our way of life and the spread of 
goodwill.  

Most likely we are all in agreement that a forceful 
military strike will initiate this new campaign;  I 
think there is quite a bit of confusion over what we 
really are about to embark on.  Our army may well 
include the corporate army and the casualties will be 
civilian.  We need to get every American to study this 
condition, it's roots, causes, directions and what we 
can do to end it.  Americans need to start an 
intelligent dialogue, around the country publicly so 
that we can demonstrate to ourselves and the rest of 
the world that we are educated and serious about 
achieving a solution.  Our military domination is 
already known throughout the world. 

Perhaps our long-term goal may involve bolstering the 
middle-class communities in these nations assuming 
they are moderate, tolerant and peace-loving; they 
need something to lose, and conversely, something to 
protect.  To get there we will need to eradicate any 
fundamentalist governments like the Taliban, under no 
circumstances can they be trusted going forward ever. 
We will need to partner with each nation and hunt the 
terrorist organizations down within their borders.  We 
need to seize assets, disable communications, engage 
in an unprecedented Intelligence campaign.   

Let's focus our efforts on thinking and providing our 
leadership with a collective strategy and wisdom, an 
opinion from within.  While I trust the powers that be 
to handle these affairs,  I never believed any day in 
my life that we were so vulnerable. 

Know the enemy. The threat of bio-chemical weapons - a 
simple overview of what the most likely agents are. 
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/deadlygas0210.html
<http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/deadlygas0210.html>  

There is one company in America that is contracted by 
the DOD to produce the Anthrax vaccine, the BioPort 
Corporation, formerly known as the Michigan Biologic 
Products Institute (MBPI).  I hope the defense around 
that company is solid. 

Hopefully, this will generate some interest in 
developing a public discussion regarding strategies 
for the eradication of terrorism and governments that 
support them actively, tacitly or otherwise.  bin 
Laden  Imad Mughniyeh, head of the special overseas  

operations for Hizbullah, and the Egyptian Dr Ayman 

  Al Zawahiri, senior member of Al-Qaeda and possible

and the Taliban should go first, then perhaps 
the other organizations mentioned above.  Then what 
Hussein, Qaddafi?  Will Egypt be on board when the Al 
Jihad unleash terror in Egypt?  Do these nations host 
silently in exchange for less or no terrorism within 
their borders, completely bending to the will of 
terrorists for fear of their people being injured?  Is 
that support or a successful campaign of terror? Where 
do we draw the line?  I suppose where you stand after 
Tuesday is a good start?  Who's next?  How do we 
prioritize? Will they are be lined up behind the US in 
1 year? 

Be strong,  Be prepared, Be smart, Be heard, God Bless 
America

Eddie,

Thanks for the note. This has been a very scary and tough time, but I'm hoping something good can come from it. We are trying very hard to sell the trading operation intact to several institutions. I'm sure you have read about it. After the suffering you and all the other people who live and work in the NYC financial district have gone through this year, this pales in comparision. We're all hangin' tough.

Best wishes in this holiday season to and your family,
your friend
Andy

Hate to pile on but I think KM is circling the drain here. I told your mom a couple of weeks ago that there is high probablility they file chpt 11 by end of first quarter. Get out while you can. Hope boarding went well for you and you didn't break anything.

Mike

I attach a letter of intent which I hope covers all the points we discussed this morning. On the basis that you asked for a memorandum of understanding the attached draft is fairly legalistic in tone. If you wanted something more informal let me know.

Paul - let me know if you have any comments.

Greg and Philippe

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.


Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
AZ

Kabul, Afghanistan---October 4, 2001--  A shocking development took place  today as the ruling members of the Taliban  held a press conference threatening the  United States if its territory is  invaded.  Immigration Czar  Mohmammed Ali Momaluke stated that the Afghan  authorities "would not hesitate  for a moment" to cut off the US supply of convenience store managers.

                reset swap px: 2.70
                resets to: 3.10

               resets to 3.35
               reset trigger: 3.35
       

The mechanics of the swap are as follows:  It is a normal swap at the reset swap price unless a particular reference month settles at or above the reset trigger. In that case that month and only that month's reference price resets to the new price as specified in "resets to." all other months remain unaffected until they settle and we go through the same process all over again.

Hi Andy,

The following spreadsheets represent net generated positions on bullets and strips through the date indicated on the name of the spreadsheet.  I only looked back 90 days, so it won't include any of the strip trading (not a lot) done prior to July 25.  If you want me to have these included, let me know.

Thanks!

I believe the attached note accurately summarizes our position. We do not see anything changing. The deal remains terminated for the reasons below.

Subject:	HoustonStreet Demonstration

On May 22, 2001 HoustonStreet representatives (Frank Getman, John Wyman and David Cuadros) came to Enron to give us a demonstration of the gas interfaces.  HoustonStreet was allowed to load the required .cab files on the demonstration computers prior to the demonstration.  HoustonStreet provided us with a script to follow relative to the demonstration as well as a list of test and production mappings.  During the demonstration we experienced the following:

1 - 8 second delays between a price update on EnronOnline and a price update on HoustonStreet.  With just five products active we experienced a delay of up to 5 seconds.  Due to the delay in price updates, transaction attempts on the HoustonStreet platform resulted in a high percentage of failed transactions with Enron.
When we activated Product ID 16612 (US Gas Basis PEPL Jun-Oct01) the product showed up on EnronOnline but did not show up on HoustonStreet.  HoustonStreet provided us with a list of products which had been mapped in the test environment and this product was included on the list.  HoustonStreet indicated that they had verified the mapping of all the products on this list.  We reviewed the mapping of this product by Enron and confirmed that it was active and mapped.  Incorrect mapping of products has the potential of allowing transactions to occur with mismatched product types.
When we attempted to transact on Product ID 16600 (US Gas Basis NGI Chicago Jun-Oct01) we were unable to complete a transaction even when the bid and offer prices were not changing.  These transaction attempts should have resulted in successful transactions.  We also experience instances where the bid and/or offer price would disappear after a failed transaction attempt and not reappear even thought the price was still present on EnronOnline.  In many cases the price would disappear for up to 30 seconds or more.  Although we did not witness any incorrect transactions, general functionality failure may or may not result in incorrect transactions.  At a minimum this type of behavior would result in frustration on the part of the counterparty when a transaction attempt results in a failure with no subsequent price move or a disappearing price.
A review of the transactions we recorded versus the transactions indicated by HoustonStreet reveals some discrepancies.  In an email from John Wyman dated 5/23 (forwarded seperately), John Wyman indicated that they had cleaned their database just prior to 3:00 PM and gave us just the trade count beginning at 14:58 on 5/22.  Although there has not been a deal by deal reconciliation of the trades, we compared our total trade count beginning at 14:58.  If the deal counts do not match this would result in substantial financial exposure.  Below I have highlighted the HoustonStreet transactions by counterparty versus the EnronOnline transaction count:

			HSE	EOL

	Arizona		 12	 14
	Avista		 03	 03
	Adams		 17	 19
	BP		 57	 58
	
	Total		 89	 94
	
Based upon my review of the demonstration, I continue to believe there significant potential exposure associated with the HoustonStreet interfaces.

Dave,

Mike mentioned that he was going to speaking to you in regards to the estate. Just wanted to let you know that I have a very high opinion of him. He is extremely sharp and is one of the more capable traders I've dealt with in non-trading commercial situations. When he worked for me at EnronOnline I always viewed him one of my best folks. Do what you will with this unsolicited opinion, but I thought it best if I let you know. 

Regards,
Andy

OpenLink is one of the leaders in risk management systems. We used at Coral, and it was then called Abacus. It is strongest in front office risk management. I would view their competition as KioDex. The deal with Duke has been around for awhile.

Hi Savita,

Jennifer and I have been looking through the ICE volumes on physical gas and it looks like nearly  all of their really huge Nat Gas volumes are being done on firm, physical, CUSTOM trades. It's probably a good bet that these "custom" products are some sort of structured or one-off deals that are not available to the general trading public on their website, but are instead closed, large-scale transactions done between the various ICE entities as a means of pumping up their volumes.

I've gone through the attached spreadsheet and highlighted several examples of these "custom" deals and have spoken with Bob Shults to see if he has any contacts at ICE that might be able to shed light on exactly what these things are. He hasn't called anyone yet, however, and I've asked him not to until you and Andy have had a chance to go over this. 

Could be something, could be nothing...

Torrey

There are 2 sheets in the following attachment that contain Enron transactional data for the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Dynegy Direct, labeled as follows:
"Enron Activity - Dynegy Direct"
"Enron Activity - ICE"

 

Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Gentlemen:

	Here is a revised draft of the Co-Marketing Agreement.  This is not
final and should not be released to Kiodex.  This is an internal draft for
our review.  We can send it along tomorrow, after Travis and I finish
addressing the open issues, which are:

	1.	How should we describe the Change of Control exception for
Warburg, in light of the term sheet that gives Warburg rights to future
financing.  Should we stick with the single transaction?

	2.	We need to confirm the response time in Section 6.6(d).
Kiodex wants to change 0.25 sec to 2 or 3 sec.

	3.	We need to confirm what information will be included in the
Enron Transaction Data, and which data Kiodex will have to extract or add.

	4.	I deleted the termination right in Section 8.3(k) on the
assumption that we are going to a concurrent closing.

	5.	I would like to confirm that the definition of the Kiodex
Application is okay.  I made that up, and no one has ever commented on it.

	There may be some other minor points, but I think that this is most
of it.

	Travis, I will call you tomorrow afternoon.

	Best regards,

	Ted

Subject: NEW WEATHER SWAPS ON THE INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE


  <http://www.intcx.com/weather/images/header7.gif>
IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week. Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and support for these new products.
To trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email. 
We encourage all or our users to take a serious look at the new weather products being offered by the IntercontinentalExchange. Please contact one of our following representatives to find out about the new weather products, or check back on our website product guide:

Sorry to see the absorption of TQ by APB. I suppose it is all for the best.  Hope that you guys come out of it allright. The irony is that TQ outlived Enron ! Haven't spoken to you in a awhile and hope that all is well with you and your family. Call me when you get a chance to catch up.

Hi Andy and happy new year...

I chose one in NJ for my own use.

I did get some recommendations from some other people that were NY lawyers:

Jerry Solomon at Gallet, Dryer & Berkey 212-935-3131.

I have another somewhere, and I'll try to send it along.

Subject: Independent Kiodex analysis of EnronOnline risk?


Greg, we've been able to load thousands of EnronOnline trades into our Risk
Workbench, and we've correctly run risk reports on them.  Might we be of
service to Enron by loading ALL the EnronOnline trades into the Risk
Workbench, and running our risk reports on the aggregate?  I'm thinking that
such an independent analysis of at least part of Enron's risk position might
answer the requests, expressed among analysts and pundits in the FT, the
WSJ, and elsewhere, for greater disclosure.

Everyone is excessively worried about mysterious packages these days.  Just
as Enron pioneered transparency in the energy markets, Enron can set the
gold standard for disclosure of aggregate risk.  (I know the other dealers
will want to squirm their way out of following suit.)  I have supreme
confidence in Enron's risk controls, and I'm thinking that an independent
measurement of this kind could dispel the market's overblown and baseless
fears.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Kind regards
Marty

GLENDALE, CA- Rock guitarist Steve Vai wowed a group of neighborhood children with his spectacular guitar pyrotechnics Monday. "His behind-the-head guitar solo was so wicked," said Jimmy Hetzel, 11, one of six children blown away by Vai's fretboard wizardry. "He also did this thing where he held the guitar between his legs and played it with a bow." The impromptu performance is believed to be the most impressive display of its kind since September 2000, when Joe Satriani "showed off a few licks" at a Southfield, MI, bar mitzvah.

Claudio,

I agree with you. The first bullet point will be easier to implement. Generally I have found that there is sufficient divergence of opinions amongst wholesale players that you can get positions on that you want. 

My goal would be to fulfill the function of both bullet points. I think there are pockets of risk management of complex relationships around the firm, but no group dedicated to it. Clearly we will need quantitative rigor to serve those functions.

questions: I am familiar with Quantos from my banking days, where a USD interest rate option pays off in a non USD currency at a fixed exchange rate. What is the specific structure of the options you are looking at.

Regards,
Andy

1). Hickerson does not have any products up yet. I need to find out from Bridges where we are with Cargill. He has been in meetings all morning, I will revert when I know.

2). To be honest I think we are nowhere with Dow, but I have left that to Berberian. I haven't heard a peep from anyone on this. I will find out.

3). I think it is 50/50 on GM. They clearly are interested, but are not very clear on what they are trying to accomplish. They do want to make markets. I think our best bet is an EOL product hosting deal, but their internal process will be excruciating. Next step is they will meet with alan Engberg to discuss listing 7 to 8 petchems on EOL.

4). I have not been moving forward on service level contract because I do not think it really adds any value at the present time.

5). I do think we should seriously consider the case for charging an access fee to EOL. This should not be viewed as a commission.

6). I spoke with Vin Viola of NYMEX and he is interested in pursuing this idea of clearer as credit sleeve for locals. He is tough to pin down and negotiate with but we will run this down by end of next week.

7). Re:kiodex, it is coming slowly as we have a lot of things on the development/testing schedule right now.

8). As you know we are in receipt of the ICE API. We have not been able to do much work on it given 7).

Subject:	Value Proposition for Enron from TechSpan


Hi Andy

Hope you have had a chance to review our earlier details and hopefully it
would have given you further insights into our capabilities.

During the recent Board meeting with Goldman Sachs, our Enron strategy was
discussed and we indicated our correspondance with you. All of us are very
exited and working on ways of initiating the process. Moreover, due to the
strategic nature of partnership, our Management has also decided to invest
in developing this association.

I would discuss the proposition (from our Senior Management) during a
telecon and you could assess the feasibility.

Meanwhile, some areas that we are currently working with Goldman Sachs,
Nortel, Chevron, HP, etc are indicated below and we could replicate the same
with Enron:


1.	Module Development or enhancements to existing applications
      - Portal
      - Adaptor/Connector Development
      - Integrating online trading apps with Back End systems
      - Ariba customization/enhancements
      - Content Management
      - e-Procurement &  EBPP
      - other application specific integration

2.	Maintenance & enhancements (Could be done in India for cost saving
and round the clock operations)
3.	Re-engineering, Migration and porting for your existing applications

4.	QA

Andy, we are confident that this proposition of ours would be very
attractive and would go a long way in developing a strong association.

Could we discuss our business proposition this week ? I could call your
admin assistant tommorow (6/5) and fix up a suitable time for the call (10 -
15 Minutes Max.) We could follow this up with a technical meeting to
identify specific areas, should you feel comfortable with our proposition.

Looking forward to our discussions.

Thks, Arvind

Company)


Dear Andy

Thanks for your Mail. I sincerely hope you were able to get a high level
overview of our company. Further to my earlier mail, i am enclosing the
information which could provide further insight into our company. Pls
include them in your assessment process and give me a feedback if you
require any further clarification. We look forward to meeting you and your
team for an  presentation and the value we could bring to Enron. In the
presentation, we would cover our Methodology, Processes, Competencies,
Clients , Case Study & our economical/cost effective deployment processes.

Some synergies i perceive; Enron's initiative in ClickPaper could map well
based on our experience in Forest Express , EnronOnline could map into our
experience with RMX/Chevron or American Petroleum Exchange, Dealbench.com
maps well with our experience with eBreviate on the hosted ASP model for
eRFP,Auctions,Supplier Search. Moreoever, our development labs in India
could add great value for your module development, ongoing support,
maintenance, QA, Porting work; deploying a very low cost structure.

1.	TechSpan Details: I have enclosed the following -

	1.1 Company Overview (Management, Revenues, Growth, Locations,
Services, Competencies,  etc)
	1.2 TechSpan B2B Markets Expertise Brochure
	1.3 Case Study - e2Open , Traiana
	1.4 Projects with Ariba & MOAI

2.	Other Details which could be of interest

	2.1 TechSpan has been featured on IDC's analysis (Report No. 23918)

	" IDC believes that TechSpan has done a good job of melding its
evolution as a services business to that of its 	partnerhips"

	2.2.  BEA's Partner brochure on its competency (attachment), wherein
TechSpan has been evaluated at par with KPMG & 	CSC. All our clients have
also realized the value in TechSpan and all have positioned us equivalent
(and higher in many 	cases)to any Big 5 Consulting firm.

	2.3.  INDIAN E-BIZ CONSULTING MARKET WORTH $136 M.: V&D

	TechSpan tops the Big Six list of e-biz consultants in India with
total business worth $67 million, followed by 	Planetasia and MindTree. The
study has identified pricing as the one big advantage enjoyed by Indian pure
play 	Internet Professional Services companies.

	2.5.  TechSpan Ranked on Sm@rtReseller's Smart 100 Companies List

      http://www.techspan.com/news/prsmartreseller.html


In summary, we are a young company (two years in operations) with high
ambitions and clearly articulated vision of being a leader in the e-commerce
consulting space. We have achieved major milestones in being a $ 67.0
Million company within 2 years, largely due to the confidence exhibited by
our customers and partners. Though the above are some achievements in the
past (giving you a base comfort factor on our long term stability), we are
keen in discussing what value we could bring to Enron, now and in the
future.

In Germany, Berlin's minister for culture Adrienne Goehler called the World Trade Center twin 110-story towers destroyed by the hijackers ``phallic symbols.'' The comment brought calls for her resignation, but also an explanation from Goehler. 
``In the context of my statement that the 'attacks were aimed symbolically at the heart of America,' I also made the comment that the towers are ``phallic symbols,''' she said. ``It was an answer to the question 'What sort of symbolic images did it remind me of?'''

Batten down the hatch's and get ready for young Scott's first experience with Tropical Storms ! Here comes Allison !

On another note we went live with TQ yesterday. Unbelievable huh...We did one trade with Tuscon Elec. the first day and today we did three, all with PG&E, who happen to own 40% of TQ. Pretty lame.

On a good note, we hit a record today with BrokerClient, 53 trades. 46 power and 7 gas, which is nicely diversifying.

Other interesting note: We launched Reuters on Monday and the NYMEX wants to put it up on one of their huge wallboards. They would buy a block of desktops to cover it. Bad news is that, John Arnold, my new boss in approx 25 days, with some justification thinks this is a bad idea. He will lose the ability to arb the floor against the OTC. My view is that this will go away anyway as eNymex and ICEX do the same thing. What are your thoughts ?

Hope all is well 

Andy

Mooney's are great planes and are very fast. I almost bought an MSE a few years ago, which subsequently was called the Allegro, then the Eagle. They are really well built with no incidents of inflight airframe failure ever. Drawbacks are they are quite small and there is a cloud over he comapny as it is in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy isue is around whether the supply of parts will be available going foward. They are probably being discounted which makes it a good buy. Idon't think the parts issue is a real one as someone will step in to take over the manufacturing.

Does Carol have a sister named Mimi, who is married to a guy named Steve Houston ? There is a guy I work with here who is this guy's (Houston) best friend, and the woman he is married to sounded like Carol's sister. I know it sounds complicated.....

Hope you are faring okay with the recent events.

I did confirm that Dow is now an asset deal with no interest by Dow in ENW products.

I think we should look at what everyone else charges per commodity (i.e. ICE) and think about tsomething that is at least 50% of that. and it shuold be labelled an access or system maintenance fee.

A bit of good news: NGPL has confirmed that they would like to do a 2yr product hosting deal on EnronOnline.
$150K initial startup plus $100K per year and $25 per transaction. So total value not including per transaction is $350K. I think they get 5 products, but Forster knows the details. It's a start and the crew here is pretty pumped.

I'm trying to get a lieutenant of Viol'a to work with but it is hard. Patience.

Let's meet on Monday to talk about what we were going to do on Friday.

I am in the office picking up some Stro's tix. It sure is quiet for a Saturday...creepy.

Don't know about the AGA....Seems to be that we are having harder and harder tme as an industry getting it right.

I flew to little rock last weekend for a BPPP bonanza school and had a really cool instructor who was a retired colonel in USAF and F4 pilot. Lots of good stories. Beautiful weeknd for flying.
Saw Jack Hirsch but didn't ask him about his club's bonanza...

How is yor flying going ?

Vin,

Glad we could hook up yesterday. 

The gist of what we are interested in is providing EnronOnline's liquidity to local NYMEX traders. I would like to explore the concept of NYMEX's clearing corp or another clearer standing in the middle between Enron and these locals. EnronOnline's architecture provides for a Master user, such as a Clearing Corp, to set up as many sub-users (local traders) as it wants. Each sub-user has trading rights as designated and controlled by the master. We would envision the Clearing Corp. handling it credit arrangements with the locals, and negotiating its relationship with Enron. I know this is pretty simple stuff, but every long journey starts with a small step. Please let me your interest in pursuing this sort of arrangement or a variant thereof.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper
Vice President
Enron Corp.

Eddie,

Thanks for the note. This morning I signed my contract with UBS, so I am here for another year. After that I will be wanting to move the family back to the NYC area. If you hear of anyone interested in someone where my skills would be a fit, let me know. Otherwise things are going okay and we hope to start trading again by mid feb. Hope all is well with you and your family. I'll let you know next time I am in NYC. Give me a call when you get a chance and thanks again for the support. I hope you know I would do the same for you.

Andy

Subject:	Conagra is our newest beta customer!

Last week, our sales team signed Conagra Foods, a Fortune 100 company, to a
beta license for the Risk Workbench.  Based in Omaha, ConAgra is North
America's largest foodservice supplier and the nation's second largest name
in retail foods (www.conagra.com).  In 2000, Conagra had revenues of over
$25 billion, making it 68th on the Fortune 1000 list.  Many of their
consumer brands are household names: Hunt's tomato products, Healthy Choice,
Louis Kemp, Libby's, Wesson, Country Pride, Blue Bonnet, Parkay, Reddi-wip,
Marie Callender's, Butterball, Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher's, Peter
Pan, and Swiss Miss.
They currently have a large risk management and trading operation in Omaha
that hedges their exposure to energy and agricultural prices while engaging
in some speculative trading.  Kiodex will work directly with the principals
in this division as well as senior management as they adopt the Risk
Workbench for the purpose of conducting this mission critical function.
Conagra represents a tremendous opportunity for Kiodex to enroll a Fortune
100 company in becoming a high-profile reference account for us as we launch
on August 23rd.  Our focus, beginning on July 9th, will be on converting
this trophy client into a full paying customer (they are paying to
participate in the beta program) of the Risk Workbench.  I ask all of you to
help us realize this opportunity.
I would like to especially acknowledge Russ Chalom in our sales department
for his work on this account.  For the past 2 months, he has been
aggressively courting Conagra, performing demonstrations for senior
management, including the CEO.  His lucid delivery and cogent explanation of
the Risk Workbench value proposition created this opportunity for all of us.
Well done, Russ!

Stewart,

I base my opinion on 15 years trading and marketing risk management products to corporations. When I was at Bankers Trust, every corporation we dealt with would ask after completing a deal "can you tell us where we can get a cheap off-the-shelf system that we can use to manage these things ? "

The problem KioDex has is exactly what you describe: with companies that where trading of derivative products is core to their mission, the third party ASP model is an extremely difficult one to sell. There are all the obvious reasons: security, reliability, continuity etc... What Kiodex needs to focus on, in my opinion, is the intersection of customers who need the product but don't view the function as critical to their operation.

For what it is worth.

Greg,

I know this has been a tough couple of weeks for you but I thought I would drop you a line and share my impressions:

1). This deal is an ideal opportunity to merge back and mid office support platforms. We have discussed this many times and EnronNetworks was practically set up for this (CommodityLogic et al...)
 
2). I don't know what you folks have in mind but I could see leaving ENE's market making and trading structure intact and having DYN's asset-based trading be just another business unit like EES was. but the key is the tremendous cost savings of the common support platform.

I don't mean to be presumptuous but I hadn't talked to you in a while and wanted to get it off my chest.

Good luck,
Andy

Stewart,

It is my strong belief that Kiodex will be most successful in marketing to Fortune 500 corporations. These companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core. I am interested in your thoughts, and how, if you agree, we can influence the company in this direction.

I think the note I sent to Steve plus the fact that he came to see me and I told him he was out of line are enough. We will not support the app. It seems kind of draconian to shut off the flow of information. As far as wireless in general it has never been a high priority for me because we never had a commercial basis for proceeding other than "gee, wouldn't this be cool" I think it is time to reassess the wireless angle, in terms of what it would cost to build, who would build it for us, and what we would get from the project. I'm going to ask Dave Forster to do that.

Comments ?

I get a smattering of actual, I tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago, and half the flight was in and out of the clouds. Having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference, but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience. The trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late. I have the stormscope feeding through the Garmin 530. Keep flying.

Mike,

That's fine, but no LOI is to be agreed without EnronOnline's concurrence. If you want to do something without us, go right ahead but if we are to be involved then we need to approve and be involved in the deal from the get go. Bob Shults is contacting Joe in NY as we speak.

Thanks,
Andy Zipper

Hi Andy,

When it was decided that we would accept multi-day orders, we pointed out to Lavo and John that we do system maintenance for an hour every Friday night.  Their position was anytime we take the system down for any reason, planned or un-planned, we should kill all orders to prevent someone from being unable to cancel an order while the system was down and then having it fill before he can get to it.

We actually have a plan in place to make this much better.  Effectively, we will have dual sites.  The second site will be used both for disaster recovery, as well as a convenient way to manage code releases without an outage.  Unfortunately, purchasing the hardware for this has been put on hold given the present circumstances.

Dave,

I am being told that the books and records of Enron's trading units are on aggregate marked off of a cost of funds curve. I should have that curve to you first thing Monday morning. Sorry about the delay but it is hard to get certain things done in a timely fashion around here right now.

Andy

I think it relates to Paul not getting the top job in their soon to be spun off unregulated unit. That job went to some guy named Shockley who Eric Vanderwald will report to. Their press release makes for fun reading.

Enron does not place NYMEX position limits on its desks instead using overall VAR limits. If a desk is authorized to trade a particular instrument, such as a NYMEX contract or swap, the size of that position is governed by the VAR it generates.

Small issue but annoying:

If try to modify a plo by going to the line and getting the +/- box in the row with the order there is no way to change your mind and not modify without two error messages getting generated. i.e. if you decide to leave the price unchanged and hit "set" it generates the error messages, there is no other way to get out of the window though, no x box to close it.

Hope all is well otherwise,

Andy

Harry's comments. He has a valid point on the volumetric suspension issue....i think he will launch the product but ask us to put this in the development queue.

Savita

In our testing we have found the inability to manage our wing-strikes risk.  The way it works for power markets is that most traders would be unwillling to trade more than 250MW of a wing strike without widening out the bid offer.  Similarly the risk at some point can get high enough to suspend wing strikes. In the current option manager, the only possibility is to increase or decrease the ATM suite vol (which has little effect on the wing strikes anyway).


For that reason we need a volumetric control for each strike. The volumeteric control could be a toggle which could be turned on or off. If the volumetric control toggle si on, corresponding to each strike, there would be  a maximum volume.  If  the strike is hit or lifted by that volume, that strike is automatically suspended and the trader notified. This allows the individual strike risk to be limited.  This also allows us to put some less liquid markets out there - where the price discovery is evolving. In those products we can put the volume to be limited at 100 MW for each strike making the risk more manageable.

Pls give me a call, so that we can discuss this further.

I agree.

This is consistent with the e-mail I sent recently and our conversation on the way to Zydako. I assume Webb is for it?  If he is, then it is a strategic decision.

I assume it is also a prelude to daily auctions on structured derivatives and shaped products.

Thanks.

Greg and Philippe

Having listened to the DealBench presentation at our offsite and after discussing with Jay, I would like to propose the following with respect to DealBench and EnronOnline:

1). The most valuable pieces of business functionality DealBench has are the data rooms and auctions. The first might have some going concern value, but probably not much, as IntraLinks, the king, only generates $10MM in revs per year. The second, auctions, while of value will probably be given away by competitors to get other business.

2). The technology as a whole is not severable right now, and probably not ready for prime time. Thus the chances of getting a bid for it as IPR that is above the costs of doing a deal is minimal. We have some knowledge of this from our Offline experiences.


Recommendation:

EnronOnline's auction functionality is very thin. DealBench's has a lot of good business logic built into it. While the code might not be up to our standards, it would be of value to integrate it into the EnronOnline platform. This way we take advantage of the superior EnronOnline brand and not reinvent the wheel as far as business logic is concerned. There will be some development needed to integrate and rewrite the DealBench auctions piece to accommodate the single EnronOnline login, as well as change the look and feel to an EnronOnline one, but this should be well worth it. It is my STRONG belief that there is an untapped market for energy and commodity based auctions that EnronOnline should OWN. As a part of this move we should re-deploy DealBench's auction marketing force to attack this space, which furthers the general commercial goals of ENE, as opposed to something that now is fringe at best.

Thanks,
AZ

Frank,

Thank you for bringing your team down to Houston to demonstrate the new version of the system. We appreciate the effort that HoustonStreet has made to upgrade its system, however in our view insufficient progress has been made to change our decision to terminate the Posting Agreement. Once again, thank you the effort your team put in and let's stay touch.

Jorg,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but you know how things are. I have tried to get someone in the NPC to talk to me but to no avail. I will keep trying but don't hold out much chance...

A big Mazel Tov on the engagement ! Married life is the way to go. 

I heard about Sonny. Oh well...i didn't really know him that well so i can't say if that was a loss or not.

I heard Alex is now with Allegheny Power, although I assume that is in NYC not Hagerstown, MD.

Take care and give me a call...(713) 853 6994

We will only be able to get Kiodex the customers EOL trades as per the agreement. If the customer so desire they can ask us to send their non-EOl trades to Kiodex for processing, but that is outside the Kiodex/ENW agreement.

Rick,

I've been thinking about this. I think 18 mos. for the average tenor of a trade is way too high. For John Arnold's book it would on a prospective basis be  more in line with 4 months. We would probably not make markets online on anything past 24 months for NYMEX gas and the vast majority of our trades are in the first three months. I think the same would probably be true for power, but I haven't spoken to those guys about it. 

For the NYMEX book gas I made the following assumptions:

Average tenor: 5 months

Average trades per day: 400

average volume per trade: 500,000 mmbtu

average px: $2.7/mmbtu

With 252 trading days you and up with a gross unadjusted notional of $136bn. This is simply 400*252*500,000*$2.7

You then have to adjust down for the expiration of trades during the year. If the average life was 6 months you could halve the number above, which would be conservative given our 4 month assumption.

That takes you down to $68.04bn ($136bn/2).

The next adjustment would be to factor in netting for counterparties. You are trying to estimate the net open interest per countperparty. I am working on those numbers as I write this. It stands to reason that the net number for NYMEX Gas deals would be less than $70bn. When you factor in other gas trades and power the number would rise and I will look at that.

As a basic method, does this start to get you to where you need to be ?

Andy

Screaming Japanese Schoolgirls Overturn Greenspan's Bus
TOKYO- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan described himself as "shaken but all right" Monday following an incident in which several thousand excited young Japanese fans mobbed and tipped over his tour bus after a speech at the Tokyo Dome. "Mr. Greenspan is at the height of his popularity in Japan right now," said Martine Engers, a publicist for the chairman, who is currently in the midst of a 41-city world tour. "And I guess we simply weren't prepared for this level of fan hysteria." Before military police restored order, thousands of frantically speculating youths drove the Nikkei average past 16,000.

Andy:
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier this morning.  Like I said, I just wanted to introduce myself and see who you might know that would have an interest in ice fishing.  Please feel free to contact me personally or you may also pass my information along to anyone that may have an interest.
 
My client holds a strong position in the Northeast.  They are looking to fill a Senior Gas Trading position.  They are fairly new to the gas world and seeks a professional with a solid understanding of the technical side of natural gas trading.  Somebody that is not afraid of taking "responsible" risks.  
 
Further information includes:  35,000 megawatts of generation, VAR limit of 25 million
 
The role in general would consist of approximately 35% Strategic Gas Hedging in the Northeast with the remaining balance Spec Trading.  This is a Senior Level position so my client is looking for experience as head of a desk.
 
If you have any questions or would like to talk further, please feel free to contact me via phone or email.
 
Thanks,
