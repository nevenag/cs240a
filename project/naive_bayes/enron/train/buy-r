at this point Hi everyone I have run the model and along with the contract briefs I have some questions  ideas I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing this detailed one-sided e-mail but with our schedules being so exclusive this will have to do for now Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for each contract However the JC Pennys version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items I am mentioning below I have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model so some of these comments may be mute points I plan to do that went I get back 1	Since the credit risk is developed for a time period it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data and credit rating if its chaged and re-run the model for the time remaining  I would expect this is done already 2	The default probabilities seem not to change That is if the input credit rating is E1 then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contract period For annual accounting that seems OK but in MTM it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities  That is the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world 3	Are all defaults created equal to us Look at OC It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies However we are dealing with specific types of firms where default may not mean we do not get paid Sure we still have some credit risk but its not like Montgomery Wards where the lights are being turned off for good Energy is so fundamental for a companys success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form  So financial default does not neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally 4	A while back someone said to me that may maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that dont By that I mean that perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract EES then they are more likely to improve that one that doesnt This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesnt consider This would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve 5	This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special finance team The contract briefs are to me the begimnning of this exercise  If we can combine our customers into exposure group portfolios for lack of a better term where a group has similar risk characteristics beyind the current parameter set that we define then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets 6	A technical point Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments Besides the model assumptions numerical experiments have three inherent error attributes the number of trials numerical roundoff and random number generator randomness statistical properties The first two are not a problem in this application but the last one could be Has anyone examined the effect of using different random number generators on Enrons aggregate credit risk 7	There is one last point here For most of the above points the improved analysis could make the credit risk be higher Rick

we have underway is recruiting an external advisory council  This council will be comprised of global experts on environmental and social issues from non-governmental organizations and potentially other businesses to advise us on trends and issues in this area  An outline of the advisory council structure along with categories of experts and proposed names is attached below We expect to convene meetings with this group twice a year inviting the Enron executive committee and board of directors as well as the Corporate Responsibility task force to engage in a dialogue  We plan to present a slate of possible candidates to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling later this month and would appreciate your input and any ideas by March 16 Thanks for your consideration  File External Advisoryfinaldoc

09   To All RAC Houston  London Employee s  cc   Subject RAC Teams09 As mentioned in our floor meeting recently attached are listings of teams  that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it exp ands both in volume and scope Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided t he names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adj usted from time to time Only the more senior people were included but oth ers will be included as appropriate Many will have to be multidimensional There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is respons ible for the activities of the team regardless of the RAC group that you a re in Following are several thoughts concerning this process for considera tion -09The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer the comme rcial business units and achieve this within our control framework -09Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heighten ed awareness of RAC issues De-silo-ization  -09All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged for the moment -09Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitu de among the teams -09Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect - 09Teams should meet weekly at least to discuss issues Transactions wi ll require more frequent informal meetings -09There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of credit market risk or our portfolio -09All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction Offe r to help out if needed -09If formal cross-training is necessary force it to happen -09Encourage weak links in team to perform -09Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the busin ess unit with the team present This may take one quarter to implement -09If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it with your supervisor -09Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the  PRC and compensation processes The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a cat alyst to the recent reorganization there You can have an impact This process should begin immediately20 Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort Rick 20

could be very interesting see following article Comdata is a quasi-credit card company as well as payment and services company  In their normal course of business they extend various credit lines to companies that operate fleets and they provide factoring services as well  Comdata processes about 350 million transactions per year of which about half represent diesel sales of about 15 billion

03262001 Traffic World Page 25 Copyright 2001 Gale Group Inc All rights reserved COPYRIGHT 2001 Journal of Commerce Inc Truckers still waiting for signs of pent-up freight demand earnings shortfalls layoffs loom If you are waiting for trucking to kick-start the nations economic recovery pull up a chair and wait awhile Trucking CEOs say they havent seen this slow a first quarter in a decade Perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since Swift became a public company in 1990 Phoenix-based Swift Transportation Chairman and CEO Jerry Moyes said The first-quarter trucking mantra historically has been this everybody loses money in January hopes for a break-even February and earns whatever profit there is in the quarter in March That formula may not hold this year Gregory L Quesnel president and CEO of Con-Way Transportation Services and Emery Worldwide parent CNF Inc said the current slowdown was first detected late in the third quarter last year and has become more pronounced in each successive quarter March he said has been as disappointing as the first two months this year Layoffs already are occurring at the major LTL carriers Yellow Freight System has idled as many as 1000 Teamsters and hundreds of white-collar back-office workers Most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls that will cause them to miss analysts first-quarter estimates But there are deeper fears too Marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy Small family-owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years ago Swifts volume drop-off began with shipments originating on the West Coast in January and February and it is continuing in March Moyes said Coupled with reduced demand from the Southwest Moyes said Swift will not meet analysts first-quarter earnings expectations Swift is not alone We hauled less freight in February than February a year ago said Bob Hammel executive vice president of Pittsburgh-based Pitt Ohio Express a leading privately held Eastern regional LTL carrier The slowdown in manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous Nobody anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off Even Con-Way the most profitable LTL operation in the past five years said it would have a decline in first-quarter operating income compared with the year-ago period Con-Ways tonnage declines were estimated in the mid-single-digit percentage range Roadway Express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to 11 percent below those a year ago which will result in an approximately one-half of 1 percent 05 percent decline in its operating ratio see sidebar Pat Hanley Overnite Transportations senior vice president and chief financial officer said freight figures were flat in February year over year but rose slightly in March Overnite is the exception to the LTL industry with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year January was pretty good to us but February was flat Its coming back in March Were probably up in low single digits 3 to 4 percent Were picking back up The economy has hurt us If you had asked us at the start of the year wed have said wed be up double-digits Hanley said The national economic picture is a big concern Hanley said Were not seeing pressure on prices at least not so far Were seeing customers ship 10 pallets a day instead of 20 The shipment size is coming down Certainly were concerned Well do OK but not as great as wed like Forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever stars align in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspans world The genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking which is always a first-in first-out industry in any economic slowdown To hear trucking industry leaders tell it get comfortable with beans and franks for dinner Its going to be awhile before its filet mignon time again Shippers see whats happening as well but say its still too early in the year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks All the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business levels -- definitely slower than early last year said Bill Huie assistant vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp Irving Texas With a couple of exceptions carriers we talk with have no plans for expansion in the next few months We are getting feelers about some possible lane adjustments to boost revenue But generally it appears a little early in the economic downturn for much price movement The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things Our business is down pretty substantially for the first quarter said Roger Dick spokesman for Yellow Corp parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL carriers Jevic Transportation Delanco NJ and Saia Motor Freight Duluth Ga USFreightways Corp citing what it called the nations serious economic slowdown said it expects first-quarter earnings to fall very substantially below current Wall Street consensus Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating environment USF Chairman President and CEO Samuel K Skinner added Traditionally the first quarter builds momentum slowly with March being the strongest month of the period Skinner said in a statement This year the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in January and February softening even the normal modest expectations for those two months Its not just the LTL industry thats hurting The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand-supply relationship since analyst James J Valentine began tracking the data in April 1994 Two events can cause weakness in the index according to Valentine They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak freight demand So far in 2001 we have seen the confluence of both factors but the fall-off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply Valentine wrote in his most recent Trucking Snapshot for early March Year-to-date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over year according to Valentines index while supply is up only 7 percent That would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was masked by the strong economy Valentine says In a more ominous note Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years Only a reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand-supply back in balance for the truckload sector in the near term Valentine predicts The overproduction of new Class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at manufacturers wholesalers and other retailers Used trucks have lost on average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months Anecdotally one used truck dealer Music City Truck  Equipment in LaVergne Tenn is holding a two-for-one sale on three- to five-year-old Class 8 Freightliners You can buy two for around 30000 less than a brand new Chevy Suburban SUV What that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 Class 8 truck for 70000 and depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the books this year at 35000 But assuming it has lost 30 percent of that value it may only be worth 24500 in actuality For a carrier with a 100-truck fleet that equates to a loss of more than 1 million on assets The glut may last for a while according to Valentines analysis Assuming a three-year trade-in cycle most of the Class 8 tractors in the truckload sector are just now rolling over to the used-truck market That means that overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business as did nearly 1900 carriers last year that either closed or declared bankruptcy We can see from indexes surveys and other information available to us that it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight demands will continue to be soft throughout the month Based on all of these factors we expect USFreightways profits for the first quarter to be very substantially less than published analysts forecasts Skinner said In addition severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and decreased efficiencies Skinner added Expectations at each of USFs operating companies have been affected some more than others The LTL logistics reverse logistics and freight-forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a similar period last year Skinner said Further job cuts at USF Worldwide its freight forwarder would be in the offing as cost controls at the unit would be accelerated in the wake of the softening economy Skinner said Late last year Skinner said the rebuilding process at USF Worldwide would be a two-year process But the worsening economy has made that rebuilding job harder he said We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is in fact further impeding progress in this area Skinner said During the fourth quarter of 2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001 the company has taken steps to increase cost efficiencies Among these actions are a substantial cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force These cost-control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions In the 2000 first quarter USF posted 223 million net income a 27 percent rise from the 175 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter At the time that was USFs 15th straight quarter-over-quarter earnings increase It came on 6082 million revenue an 185 percent rise in from the 5132 million revenue in the 1999 first quarter Analysts had been estimating USF to earn about 350 a share earnings for 2001 compared with actual 361 earnings per share for all of last year In the fourth quarter last year USF earned 237 million or 91 cents a share Trucking in a Snapshot Market

84 million set in February and nearly 80 million in January To put that in perspective In 1999 before the current power crisis the utilitys total power bill for the entire year was 90 million Were spending that every month now The dollars that are involved are staggering said Paula Green deputy superintendent of City Light Its a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washingtons drought which means less water in the reservoirs at city-owned dams That increases Seattles need to purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented levels Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most of that money is flowing to out-of-state utilities and power brokers who are profiting enormously from the energy crunch Last month alone the bill from Enron a Houston-based corporation was 255 million putting it well ahead of the No 2 seller Californias Sempra Energy which sold 74 million worth of electricity to City Light City Light still gets most of the 1200 megawatts necessary to serve its load from city-owned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power Administration BPA The utility buys only about 15 percent of its power on the market But that thin slice now accounts for more than 90 percent of its power costs Part of the explanation for Marchs record power-buying binge was City Lights recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the Skagit River instead of spilling it through the dams power turbines In a normal water year City Light officials would be spilling water for energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff Now theyre saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to generate power for Seattle this summer when energy prices are expected to surge even higher to more than 400 per megawatt hour Were insulating ourselves By putting out one eye now were avoiding cutting off our head later said Bob Royer City Light spokesman Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain with a 28 percent City Light rate increase so far this year More rate increases are likely on the way Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and Spokane Meanwhile Enrons revenues more than doubled last year to 101 billion Its stock prices surged to end the year at 88 a share up from 44 the year before The stock was trading at 57 a share last week It doesnt just feel unfair but immoral that these major companies like Enron are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and businesses said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills who chairs the Councils Energy and Environmental Policy Committee Theres this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the shareholders of these companies Wills said Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price caps But opponents say price caps would do nothing to encourage the construction of new power plants or energy conservation Karen Denne an Enron spokeswoman said its unfair to fault the company for selling power at prices dictated by the free market Enron is providing electricity to a market that needs it Denne said Its unfortunate when regulators are pointing fingers looking to fix blame when this is a problem of supply and demand The company hails from President George W Bushs home state of Texas and is one of the top soft money donors to political campaigns Enron and its executives gave 435000 to the Democrats and 12 million to Republicans last year according to Common Cause Its chairman Kenneth Lay has consistently been one of the top donors to Bushs presidential and gubernatorial campaigns Enron doesnt own a lot of dams or power plants Instead the company makes money as a middleman - buying power from utilities and then reselling it for a profit The company formed in 1985 from the merger of two pipeline companies has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North America Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use of the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book online You just point click and spend Its easier than Amazon said Steve Lewis a power marketer with City Light demonstrating the companys Web site It lists available power products and the asking price for both buyers and sellers Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Lights projected power needs and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next hour next day or months ahead They try to find the best price available but its clearly a sellers market Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost 30 per megawatt hour for more than 200 At times last month City Light was buying power for 450 a megawatt hour And its not because the cost of generation has gone up This is pure profit said Green deputy superintendent of City Light There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder than California whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling the power markets A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities are paying the highest prices in the nation for the next-day delivery of wholesale power However regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices In fact some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month were to neighbors Puget Sound Energy Western Washingtons largest electric utility charged City Light the highest average price of any seller last month at 303 per megawatt hour according to City Lights preliminary billing estimates Spokanes Avista Energy charged 281 That compares with Enrons average price of 173 per megawatt hour and an overall average of 194 The BPA by comparison charges City Light 22 per megawatt hour City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power delivered immediately And prices for short-term deals can be higher depending on the time of day The city has only a long-term contract with the BPA Despite the record-setting month city officials hope theyll be in better shape before the year is out Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct 1 Seattles energy independence day because thats when the city will begin receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA The historically cheap BPA power combined with a contract with a gas-fired power plant in Klamath Falls Ore should reduce the citys reliance on the open market city officials say But the BPA too has been stricken by higher market power costs and may have to increase its rates to City Light by 250 percent The City Council has already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers although its unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average person Even at a higher rate City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good long-term strategy for getting power costs under control If they succeed the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded Until then local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to Texas Jim Brunner can be reached at 206-515-5628

at this point Hi everyone I have run the model and along with the contract briefs I have some questions  ideas I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing this detailed one-sided e-mail but with our schedules being so exclusive this will have to do for now Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for each contract However the JC Pennys version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items I am mentioning below I have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model so some of these comments may be mute points I plan to do that went I get back 1	Since the credit risk is developed for a time period it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data and credit rating if its chaged and re-run the model for the time remaining  I would expect this is done already 2	The default probabilities seem not to change That is if the input credit rating is E1 then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contract period For annual accounting that seems OK but in MTM it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities  That is the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world 3	Are all defaults created equal to us Look at OC It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies However we are dealing with specific types of firms where default may not mean we do not get paid Sure we still have some credit risk but its not like Montgomery Wards where the lights are being turned off for good Energy is so fundamental for a companys success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form  So financial default does not neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally 4	A while back someone said to me that may maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that dont By that I mean that perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract EES then they are more likely to improve that one that doesnt This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesnt consider This would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve 5	This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special finance team The contract briefs are to me the begimnning of this exercise  If we can combine our customers into exposure group portfolios for lack of a better term where a group has similar risk characteristics beyind the current parameter set that we define then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets 6	A technical point Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments Besides the model assumptions numerical experiments have three inherent error attributes the number of trials numerical roundoff and random number generator randomness statistical properties The first two are not a problem in this application but the last one could be Has anyone examined the effect of using different random number generators on Enrons aggregate credit risk 7	There is one last point here For most of the above points the improved analysis could make the credit risk be higher Rick Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap Embedded Picture Device Independent Bitmap

the rest is restricted list etc Thanks Cassandra 72 Employee Trading No employee of the Company may engage in the trading of any position for the benefit of any party other than the Company whether for their own account or for the account of any third party where such position relates to any security commodity contract or derivative thereof within any Commodity Group listed in Appendix A  The only exception to this restriction is that employees may trade those items within the Commodity Groups listed under the heading Financials in Appendix A if those items do not fall within such employees responsibility at the Company Periodically certain employees their family members and anybody that is financially dependent on those employees may also be restricted from trading specific securities and derivatives thereof   In addition to these trading restrictions if any employee should at any time possess non-public information about any public company that employee the employees family members and anybody that is financially dependent on that employee shall be restricted from trading in that issue and that employee may not disclose the non-public material information to anyone that does not have a business need to know Employees must seek dispensation from the Risk Management Committee for any exception to these requirements  In no case should employees personal trading conflict with the Companys trading initiatives Employee with questions regarding employee trading and investing should contact the Companys Compliance department

at this point Hi everyone I have run the model and along with the contract briefs I have some questions  ideas I was hoping to talk to each of you so I could avoid writing this detailed one-sided e-mail but with our schedules being so exclusive this will have to do for now Every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity So no aggregate results can be obtained without having the models for each contract However the JC Pennys version can serve as a testing platform for some of the items I am mentioning below I have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model so some of these comments may be mute points I plan to do that went I get back 1	Since the credit risk is developed for a time period it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data and credit rating if its chaged and re-run the model for the time remaining  I would expect this is done already 2	The default probabilities seem not to change That is if the input credit rating is E1 then the E1 default probability curve is used for the contract period For annual accounting that seems OK but in MTM it seems to me that the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities  That is the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the MTM world 3	Are all defaults created equal to us Look at OC It seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are OK ----for that range of companies However we are dealing with specific types of firms where default may not mean we do not get paid Sure we still have some credit risk but its not like Montgomery Wards where the lights are being turned off for good Energy is so fundamental for a companys success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form  So financial default does not neccesarily mean default for EES commodity payments totally 4	A while back someone said to me that may maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that dont By that I mean that perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates the credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract EES then they are more likely to improve that one that doesnt This is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesnt consider This would be a useful MBA project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve 5	This leads me to something I hope we can acomplish in the special finance team The contract briefs are to me the begimnning of this exercise  If we can combine our customers into exposure group portfolios for lack of a better term where a group has similar risk characteristics beyind the current parameter set that we define then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets 6	A technical point Monte Carlo simulations are numerical experiments Besides the model assumptions numerical experiments have three inherent error attributes the number of trials numerical roundoff and random number generator randomness statistical properties The first two are not a problem in this application but the last one could be Has anyone examined the effect of using different random number generators on Enrons aggregate credit risk 7	There is one last point here For most of the above points the improved analysis could make the credit risk be higher Rick

meetings with this group twice a year inviting the Enron executive committee and board of directors as well as the Corporate Responsibility task force to engage in a dialogue  We plan to present a slate of possible candidates to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling later this month and would appreciate your input and any ideas by March 16 Thanks for your consideration  File External Advisoryfinaldoc
