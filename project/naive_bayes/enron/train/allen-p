use the entire amount in your money market  approx 785000 for your muni bond portfolio  After the treasury comes due on Jan 31 2002 you will have another 750000  You really dont have to worry about your margin requirements because you still get  80 of the value of your municipals credited  towards marginable securities  So the bottom line is 785m right now  Jan 31 2002 another 750m  One thing to keep in mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there  Unless you close that position you will probably get put those Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for Also if there

any questions please contact Kristin Walsh at 713 853-9510 Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuancebridge loan by the May 8th deadline   Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart  According to sources both the Republic ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis  The Democratic cauc us is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis  Many legislative Republic ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that o nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund Davis would double dip into the fund  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg islature and the governor  However it is believed once Davis discloses th e details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take plac e  Additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the lon g-term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require t hat the bond issuance happen by July 1 2001  If not the state may be in  breach of contract  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th e bridge loan legislation by May 8th having a bond issuance by July 1st wi ll be very difficult The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat e would eat the 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately  8 billion  However the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful l disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan AB 8X and AB  31X  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to 10 billion in bonds  This bi ll passed the Senate in March but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac k of Republican support  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo r community college districts  However sources report this bill may be am ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen curre ntly in AB 8X  Senator  Bowens language states that the state should get  paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be li kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy20 20 According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature Republic ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in  the General Fund  For instance Tony  Strickland has stated that only 12  of the bonds or approximately 5 billion  should be issued  Other Republ icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday  Additionally Lehman Brothers repo rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan 20 Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount094125 B Lenders0909JP Morgan090925 B 090909Lehman Brothers090910 B 090909Bear Stearns0909625 M Tax Exempt Portion09Of the 4125 B 16 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate09Taxable Rate0909577 090909Tax-Exempt Rate0909477 Current Projected20 Blended IR0909538 Maturity Date0909August 29 2001 For more details please contact me at 713 853-9510 Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday which authorizes 5  billion to create t he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority    The 5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the 5 billion that must be aut horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased or the addi tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power  going forward  Again the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz ations  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor  has  negotiated the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is  that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support   No f urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it  is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas ing power    Also there is no staff defined purpose etc for  the Calif ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority  However this can  be consi dered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea  earl ier in the crisis 20 SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy  T he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au gust 15th however some decision will likely be made earlier  According t o sources the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal though SoCal has s igned it  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass  If the legislature indicat es that it will not pas the MOU SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank ruptcy or its creditor - involuntary due to the lack operating cash 20 The second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond is suance would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X bridge loan s tating that the DWR would received 100 of its payments from ratepayers th en the utilities would receive the residual amount  In other words the st ate will get paid before the utilities  If this language is included and p assed by the legislature it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments

use the entire amount in your money market  approx 785000 for your muni bond portfolio  After the treasury comes due on Jan 31 2002 you will have another 750000  You really dont have to worry about your margin requirements because you still get  80 of the value of your municipals credited  towards marginable securities  So the bottom line is 785m right now  Jan 31 2002 another 750m  One thing to keep in mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there  Unless you close that position you will probably get put those Let me know how much you want for your Muni Proposal to be for Also if there
