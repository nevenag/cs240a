the urinal   or forcing poop in a stall This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave of panicembarrassment  This is similar to the hot flash you receive when  passing an unseen police car and speeding If you release an escapee do not acknowledge it Pretend it did not happen If you  are standing next to the farter at the urinal pretend  that you did not hearit No one likes an escapee it  is uncomfortable for all involved Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy JAILBREAK Used in conjunction with escapee Definition When forcing poop several farts slip out at a machine  guns pace This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover If this should happen do not panic  remain in the stall until everyone has left the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred COURTESY FLUSH Definition The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has to stink up the bathroom This can help you avoid  being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME WALK OF SHAME Definition Walking from  the stall to the sink to the door after you have  just stunk-up the bathroom This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you As with all farts it is  best to pretend that the smell does not exist Can be  avoided with the use of a COURTESY FLUSH OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER Definition A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it You will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with newspaper or magazine under their arm Always look  around the office for the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK PFN Definition A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency pooping goes off without incident This  group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS SAFE HAVEN Definition A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least  expect visitors Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex  entering the bathroom TURD BURGLAR Definition A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and tries  to force the door open This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work If  this occurs remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves This way you will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact CAMO-COUGH Definition A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that  you are in a stall This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS Very effective when  used in conjunction with  an ASTAIRE ASTAIRE Definition A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied If you hear an ASTAIRE leave the  bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace WATERMELON Definition A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water  This is also an embarrassing incident If you feel a WATERMELON coming on create a diversion See CAMO-COUGH HAVANA OMELET Definition A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the  toilet water Often accompanied by an escapee Try using a CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE UNCLE TED Definition A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever Could spend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper as you should  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is emptyThis benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees FLY BY Definition The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping Walk in check for  other poopers If there are others in the bathroom leave and come back again Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER   People may become suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom CRACK WHORE Definition A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus Tell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs stains and streaks Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost Try finding out when the janitor  cleans each particular bathroom Dont forget with a  good cleaninga CRACK WHORE can become a SAFE HAVEN

the urinal   or forcing poop in a stall This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave of panicembarrassment  This is similar to the hot flash you receive when  passing an unseen police car and speeding If you release an escapee do not acknowledge it Pretend it did not happen If you  are standing next to the farter at the urinal pretend  that you did not hearit No one likes an escapee it  is uncomfortable for all involved Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy JAILBREAK Used in conjunction with escapee Definition When forcing poop several farts slip out at a machine  guns pace This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover If this should happen do not panic  remain in the stall until everyone has left the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred COURTESY FLUSH Definition The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has to stink up the bathroom This can help you avoid  being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME WALK OF SHAME Definition Walking from  the stall to the sink to the door after you have  just stunk-up the bathroom This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you As with all farts it is  best to pretend that the smell does not exist Can be  avoided with the use of a COURTESY FLUSH OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER Definition A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it You will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with newspaper or magazine under their arm Always look  around the office for the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK PFN Definition A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency pooping goes off without incident This  group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS SAFE HAVEN Definition A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least  expect visitors Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex  entering the bathroom TURD BURGLAR Definition A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and tries  to force the door open This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work If  this occurs remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves This way you will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact CAMO-COUGH Definition A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that  you are in a stall This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS Very effective when  used in conjunction with  an ASTAIRE ASTAIRE Definition A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied If you hear an ASTAIRE leave the  bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace WATERMELON Definition A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water  This is also an embarrassing incident If you feel a WATERMELON coming on create a diversion See CAMO-COUGH HAVANA OMELET Definition A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the  toilet water Often accompanied by an escapee Try using a CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE UNCLE TED Definition A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever Could spend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper as you should  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is emptyThis benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees FLY BY Definition The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping Walk in check for  other poopers If there are others in the bathroom leave and come back again Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER   People may become suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom CRACK WHORE Definition A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus Tell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs stains and streaks Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost Try finding out when the janitor  cleans each particular bathroom Dont forget with a  good cleaninga CRACK WHORE can become a SAFE HAVEN
