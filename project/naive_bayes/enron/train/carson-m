There is NO Tuesday markets available today.  We can not wire cash on Monday due to the holiday.  So, Koch will allow us to make to them an "estimate payment",,, aprox $250,000.  We will cover the postions on Monday.  The difference in actual will be netted out of Tuedays payment.

Yeah,  it has been a little hectic as of late.  I am still at Enron(for now).  I have been retained as part of the trading organization to stay with this entity to see if it sells.  We go to auction on Monday and will see what happens??  I guess the interested parties are UBS Warburg and Citigroup.  Good companies, but I will have to see what the $offer$ is for me personally.  Anyway, the family is doing GREAT and is looking forward to Christmas.  Harris is about 14mos now, so he kind of understands the whole presents thing, which should be fun!

Have a happy holiday!

I haven't heard from you in a while and I was wondering how the bankruptcy
has affected you.  Please send me a note or call me at work(816) 218-1606
or at home (913) 642-9758.  Hope you're doing well!

1999 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK. 
ESCAPEE 
Definition: 
  A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal   or 
forcing poop in a stall. This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave 
of panic/embarrassment.  This is similar to the hot flash you receive 
when  passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an 
escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you  are 
standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend  that you did not 
hearit. No one likes an escapee, it  is uncomfortable for all involved. 
Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. 
JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) 
Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine  guns 
pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover. If this 
should happen do not panic,  remain in the stall until everyone has left 
the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.  
COURTESY FLUSH 
Definition: The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of 
the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an 
undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has 
to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid  being caught doing the 
WALK OF SHAME. 
WALK OF SHAME 
Definition: Walking from  the stall, to the sink, to the door after you 
have  just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment  
if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is  best to 
pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be  avoided with the use of a 
COURTESY FLUSH. 
OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER 
Definition: A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You 
will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with   
newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look  around the office for 
the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom. 
THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN) 
Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency 
pooping goes off without incident. This  group can help you to monitor 
the whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS. 
SAFE HAVEN 
Definition: A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you 
can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the 
opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex  entering 
the bathroom. 
TURD BURGLAR 
Definition: A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and 
tries  to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and 
vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If  this 
occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves. This way you 
will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact. 
CAMO-COUGH 
Definition: A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the 
bathroom that  you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a 
WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when  used 
 in 
conjunction with  an ASTAIRE. 
ASTAIRE 
Definition: A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD 
BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that 
the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the  bathroom 
immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace. 
WATERMELON 
Definition: A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet 
water.  This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON  
coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. 
HAVANA OMELET 
Definition: A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes 
in the  toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a 
CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE. 
UNCLE TED 
Definition: A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever. Could 
spend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the  
pot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper, as 
 you 
should  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty.This 
benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. 
FLY BY 
Definition: The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, 
check for  other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and 
come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People may 
become suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom. 
CRACK WHORE 
Definition: A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus. 
Tell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs, stains and streaks. 
Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost. Try finding out when the janitor  cleans 
each particular bathroom. Don't forget with a  good cleaning,a CRACK 
 WHORE 
can become a SAFE HAVEN.

Hey - Cat Fans

Only 5 days until the first game and the first  watch party of the year for
the KSU Wildcats!   An event that we all  have been eagerly awaiting!

Good luck to all of you that are going to  California.  Bring back a
victory!  For those of us staying here in  soggy Texas, don't forget to
come to the SRO in the Northwest Mall at 5:30 this  coming Saturday to
watch the game!!  Northwest is located at the  intersection of the Highway
290 and 610 Loop West.  The SRO opens directly  into the parking lot facing
north.  Check our web site for more information  houalum.zk-state.com.  As
we have said  before,  this new SRO has outstanding new televisions and a
great sound  system.  The whole place is new and quite spiffy.  However,
they still  have the same outstanding hamburgers!

Our new Houston Alumni Club polo shirts are in and will be on  sale
Saturday.  Price is $35.00 and these shirts are really sharp!   Purple of
course, with black collar and cuffs with a white stripe.    Shirts are
perfect for casual business wear and you can boast about Kansas State  at
the same time!  We have a limited amount so come early to get your  shirt!
We have ordered new purple tee shirts but have not yet received  them.
They should be here by Saturday and the price will be  $15.00.

SEE YOU SATURDAY!  GO CATS!

Joyce '85 and Ken' 57  Nesmith

Hi Carson,
It was so good to see you over the  weekend.  I am a little tired today.  Our flight home was much  smoother then our flight to NC.  Hope yours was as well.  Will you  send me that sight we discussed.  I'd like to check it out.
 
Keep in touch.

Great!  Just go to the Hotel and check in.  We should be back at the
hotel at about 3pm.  Call Tara's parents house (Scott & Gaye) @
402.362.7591 if you need anything.  You will need to go down to the tux
shop and try on your tux that evening sometime.  Hopefully right when
you get in.  We might just all do it at 3:30pm......pbw

Evidently,  there is a NEW SRO over by the old one ,,,, where they are having the watch party.... all new Tv's ect...,,,, same cold beer(what matters).... what do ya think about that??

MC

see attch below---->


Hey - Cat Fans
 
Only 5 days until the first game and the first  watch party of the year for the KSU Wildcats!   An event that we all  have been eagerly awaiting!  
 
Good luck to all of you that are going to  California.  Bring back a victory!  For those of us staying here in  soggy Texas, don't forget to come to the SRO in the Northwest Mall at 5:30 this  coming Saturday to watch the game!!  Northwest is located at the  intersection of the Highway 290 and 610 Loop West.  The SRO opens directly  into the parking lot facing north.  Check our web site for more information  houalum.zk-state.com.  As we have said  before,  this new SRO has outstanding new televisions and a great sound  system.  The whole place is new and quite spiffy.  However, they still  have the same outstanding hamburgers!  
 
Our new Houston Alumni Club polo shirts are in and will be on  sale Saturday.  Price is $35.00 and these shirts are really sharp!   Purple of course, with black collar and cuffs with a white stripe.    Shirts are perfect for casual business wear and you can boast about Kansas State  at the same time!  We have a limited amount so come early to get your  shirt!  We have ordered new purple tee shirts but have not yet received  them.  They should be here by Saturday and the price will be  $15.00.
 
SEE YOU SATURDAY!  GO CATS!
 
Joyce '85 and Ken' 57  Nesmith

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

I was trying to get on some of the USAF Base sites.  They seem to all be down.  Have they shut them off for security reasons??

Hey what's up?!
When is it? He told me about it, but I can't remember when it is.

Are you going?

How's everything going?  Wife, kid--good?  Not much here...I'm have started selling photos to a few magazines and to some realtors.  I am getting some prints made to try and get into some galleries around here(and to sell on the side).  No girlfriend, not going out very much at all, doing alot of mtn. bike races, climbing alot of mtns., taking alot of photos, and enjoying life in the mtns.--that's pretty much what's been happening in my life.

Talk to you later,
Cody

ps, use codydownard@hotmail.com
since I don't work in HR anymore, it's kinda hard for me to check this email address regularly.

Teresa, I have noticed that the Entergy Jan-Dec02 contract has not shown up
on EOL since 9/4.  Is this because no one is trading it anymore, and have
lost interest?

Mike,

Let me first introduce myself -- I have responsiblity for a couple of sites in Louisiana as part of the Generation Development Group.  We are trying to determine if we should continue to develop these sites (permitting and interconnection) or just sit on the land options.  Obviously there is more cost associated with the permitting and interconnection activity and we are at a critical juncture in both activities (whether to proceed or stop).  I would like to discuss at your earliest convenience.  The sites are located in Calcasieu and St. Charles Parishes.  

Please call me x.39298.  Thanks, Ron Tapscott.

Subject:	KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants


The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

It looks like they may be wavering a bit.  The only catch is that the redir=
ect must be done 2 days ahead of time..  Also, there must be firm transmiss=
ion available on the redirected path.  Currently, in the short term at leas=
t, there is no firm transmission to any place of value,,,,ie SOCO, AMRN, TV=
A.  Entergy is still, unfortunately, LONG JAIL...
If you guys read this notice any different, please let me know.

Effective 10:00 AM, Wednesday August 22, 2001, Entergy will begin accepting=
 partial term REDIRECTS on a firm basis.  Entergy believes the guidelines l=
isted below are necessary to manage the redirects on a firm basis, and succ=
essfully allow the recalled portion of the original reservation to become a=
vailable for other customers to purchase. If you have any questions, please=
 call David McNeill at 870-541-3931 or Cameron Warren at 870-543-5497.



Section 22.2 - Modification on a Firm Basis

a) As available, Entergy's transmission customers may modify the source/sin=
k or POR/POD of confirmed firm point-to-point service on a firm basis at no=
 additional cost per section 22.2 and Attachment 'M' of the OATT.

b) Requests to modify on a firm basis will be treated as a new request for =
firm service.

c) Requests to modify on a short-term firm basis must be submitted via OASI=
S using the REDIRECT function no later than 12:00 noon two days prior to th=
e start of the redirected service. Requests to modify on a long-term firm b=
asis (twelve months or longer) will be processed according to the current b=
usiness practices for original long-term firm service.

d) Request to modify on a firm basis must be pre-confirmed.

e) The REDIRECT request must include the assignment number of the original =
request in the related reference field.

f) Requests to modify on a firm basis must specify the exact same capacity =
as the original request.

g) Requests to modify on a firm basis must not be for an interval of the or=
iginal reservation in which a previously submitted schedule exists.

h) Requests to modify on a firm basis may be submitted in daily, weekly, mo=
nthly, or yearly service increments.

i) Requests to modify on a firm basis must be within the time interval of o=
riginal reservation (the REDIRECT cannot start before the original start da=
te or end after the original end date).

j) Upon acceptance of a REDIRECT request, the customer loses their rights t=
o the redirected interval of the original request and Entergy will release =
the original reserved capacity back to the market. If the customer wishes t=
o revert back to the original path they must submit another REDIRECT subjec=
t to the same guidelines as all other new REDIRECT requests.

k) When applicable, rollover rights will be given on the original reservati=
on only.

This looks fun!  I'll be in the moonwalk!

Subject:	RIBFEST -5- (Nov. 3rd)


The World Wide RibFest "celebration of the Rib" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a "peoples choice" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	"So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?"
			          I reply:	"Nothing comes to mind."	
		               She replies:	"No." 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing "personal reasons"

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.

New proposition!

Looks like fiedler has got to score over 32 tonight.....He's never done that before has he??

Lets say 70/30 split now (Me with the 70%),,,, no matter who wins,,, I believe this gets you an extra $100 or so... Not such a bad deal when you look at the odds!  Give me a shout and will discuss....

Mike,

If you have any trouble finding the restaurant, I've included directions
below:


To Chapel Hill from RDU Airport:

Take  I-40 West and proceed to exit 273 B which is
highway 54 West.

Proceed on 54 West which turns into Raleigh Road. Do not exit on 54-15-501
Bypass. At Country Club Road turn right. This is 3.9 miles from I-40.

Drive on Country Club Road for .4 mile and turn right on Raleigh Street.

Drive .2 mile on Raleigh Street to Franklin Street ( this is the main
street that runs through downtown Chapel Hill) and turn left on Franklin
Street.

Proceed west on Franklin Street and you will see  University Presbyterian
Church on your right  .3 mile and then continue another .4 mile and you
will see Michael Jordan's 23 on your right.

If you have any trouble, please call my cell (913) 481-4632.

Thanks,

Devin

Mike,

Thanks for the note, it was good to hear from you.  Quick update on us,
Laura and I bought a house in late September.
Our new address is 14501 W. 86th Street, Lenexa, KS, 66215.  Our house is
located in the Cedars development just off
of 87th St. and Lackman Rd.   Is this close to where you used to live?  All
of our family is doing well, we've  been getting
ready for Christmas (tree, lights, etc.).

I hope everything goes well with your work!

Yeah,  it has been a little hectic as of late.  I am still at Enron(for
now).  I have been retained as part of the trading organization to stay
with this entity to see if it sells.  We go to auction on Monday and will
see what happens??  I guess the interested parties are UBS Warburg and
Citigroup.  Good companies, but I will have to see what the $offer$ is for
me personally.  Anyway, the family is doing GREAT and is looking forward to
Christmas.  Harris is about 14mos now, so he kind of understands the whole
presents thing, which should be fun!

Have a happy holiday!

Boys, 

I'd be delighted to gather and format all of the information for a "nice and pretty" presentation. I would just ask that you e-mail me your info by the end of Wednesday, Feb. 6.

All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may "only" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.

I was wondering how your job was going.  I've obviously heard all the media
hype surrounding your company.  Please send me a email with an update.

Dear Friends,
Just a note to remind you that we will be meeting on Wednesday  this week instead of Thursday. We will have our Christmas Party at Brian and  Lori Long's home in Pearland. I discovered  today that some names were on  my e-mail list and not the database list that I sent to Brian and Lori to work  from. So if you can come, and have not indicated so, please let me know.  We would love to see all of you. For those of you who can't be with us, we will  miss you. See all of you in January.Here is the invitation website: http://www.evite.com/r?iid=BUFVYXGQNZOJHNOWFBSG  It has  the address, time and directions. Hope to see you then. Lori and Brian have  worked hard on the plans. I know we will have a wonderful time in their home.

There is NO Tuesday markets available today.  We can not wire cash on Monday due to the holiday.  So, Koch will allow us to make to them an "estimate payment",,, aprox $250,000.  We will cover the postions on Monday.  The difference in actual will be netted out of Tuedays payment.

Yeah,  it has been a little hectic as of late.  I am still at Enron(for now).  I have been retained as part of the trading organization to stay with this entity to see if it sells.  We go to auction on Monday and will see what happens??  I guess the interested parties are UBS Warburg and Citigroup.  Good companies, but I will have to see what the $offer$ is for me personally.  Anyway, the family is doing GREAT and is looking forward to Christmas.  Harris is about 14mos now, so he kind of understands the whole presents thing, which should be fun!

Have a happy holiday!

MC

or at home (913) 642-9758.  Hope you're doing well!

1999 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK. 
ESCAPEE 
Definition: 
  A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal   or 
forcing poop in a stall. This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave 
of panic/embarrassment.  This is similar to the hot flash you receive 
when  passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an 
escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you  are 
standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend  that you did not 
hearit. No one likes an escapee, it  is uncomfortable for all involved. 
Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. 
JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) 
Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine  guns 
pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover. If this 
should happen do not panic,  remain in the stall until everyone has left 
the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.  
COURTESY FLUSH 
Definition: The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of 
the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an 
undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has 
to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid  being caught doing the 
WALK OF SHAME. 
WALK OF SHAME 
Definition: Walking from  the stall, to the sink, to the door after you 
have  just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment  
if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is  best to 
pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be  avoided with the use of a 
COURTESY FLUSH. 
OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER 
Definition: A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You 
will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with   
newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look  around the office for 
the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom. 
THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN) 
Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency 
pooping goes off without incident. This  group can help you to monitor 
the whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS. 
SAFE HAVEN 
Definition: A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you 
can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the 
opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex  entering 
the bathroom. 
TURD BURGLAR 
Definition: A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and 
tries  to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and 
vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If  this 
occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves. This way you 
will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact. 
CAMO-COUGH 
Definition: A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the 
bathroom that  you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a 
WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when  used 
 in 
conjunction with  an ASTAIRE. 
ASTAIRE 
Definition: A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD 
BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that 
the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the  bathroom 
immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace. 
WATERMELON 
Definition: A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet 
water.  This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON  
coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. 
HAVANA OMELET 
Definition: A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes 
in the  toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a 
CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE. 
UNCLE TED 
Definition: A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever. Could 
spend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the  
pot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper, as 
 you 
should  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty.This 
benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. 
FLY BY 
Definition: The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, 
check for  other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and 
come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People may 
become suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom. 
CRACK WHORE 
Definition: A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus. 
Tell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs, stains and streaks. 
Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost. Try finding out when the janitor  cleans 
each particular bathroom. Don't forget with a  good cleaning,a CRACK 
 WHORE 
can become a SAFE HAVEN.
