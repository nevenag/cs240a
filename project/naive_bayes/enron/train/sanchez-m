Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email Perspective comes   quickly   at 8000 meters and today thinking back on the ascent and all the rock   climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my   perpetually clumsy condition wrsened by AMS I am happy to be alive The   weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead   and   dying including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late   for   the north side By the time i am allowed to send this the media will have   already begun reporting on this tragedy I was slowed by my vomiting and   had   i continued i likely would have been trudging up with this group     In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends   ensuring   his safety so suz and i could take a vacation He is stuck on the ridge   now   dying and will likely be dead by morning One of our strongest guides is   with him and he too will probably die This guy is super strong but the   altitude has snatched him Were in shock here and can do nothing but   stare   into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight I have been   assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives   A   member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp 2 this morning 3   Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge and a spaniard is flirting   with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema despite Chris   Warners valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night When i   think of this mountain now i think only of death     Russ is quite experienced in hig-altitude rescues but this is the first   time   he has unleashed the team for our own It is a totaly professional   logistical operation locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up   into the jet stream relying heavily on the sherps who are just   incredibly   strong Many stories of heroism over last 24 hours and many to come The   guide and the client spent the night on the ridge 8650 meters   incoherent   and immobile freezing but they were saved when Asmus turned around from   a   desperate stumble home climbed the second step brutal for the second   time   in 10 hours and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark   Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes   reaching   top camp 8300 metersstill incredibly dangerous at 1130 pm It was a   relatively warm night just belowand both client and guide were seen   moving   space blankets this morning through the telescope Alive But they could   not   stand One could not see No comms Bivouacs above 8000 meters are epics   and   you are sure to read about this     Coordinating therescue from the Col Russ then rousted all available   bodies   and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days Purba   and   Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone humping oxygen The   American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up   their summit attempt remember they failed last week and also failed in   99   so this is a huge sacrifice to make the rescue It looked bleak this   morning but after some injections our teammates began to move carried by   the strong Americans As i type they have been moving at a snails pace   and   the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselvesWe hope our   sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be   an   absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue Remember that ridge is   14   inches across for stretches dropping 10000 feet on either side When i   gazed down 2 nights ago it was truly like staring out of the window of a   plane so steep was the drop The sherps are going to have to be supermen     From the ridge and high camp chris and asmus theyve been wasting there   for over 36 hours now have been gathering oxygen for the 2000 meter   descent   to ABC They are sucking some themselves to ensure we dont have a   double-rescue Im feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help   with the rescue assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive Too high   for a helo on this side so well have to platoon them down asap Other   members who summitted earlier are still up too high too slow descending   from safe camps and i may help them down as well So i will not be back   by mem day--we have to get these people down     The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope sulking   and making occasional trips to the waste moraine The client was slower   and   slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field I thought uh   oh   Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold   and the guide was pursuaded by the client Soon russ was on the radio   screaming at the guide to drag the client down but the hour grew late and   suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap both men immobile   and nearly incoherent the guide kicking and draggin the client to no   avail Asmus was with them and performed valiantly as i mentioned but no   one was in a position to help At that height every second counts and the   other teams rushed past on their way to safety When you rush into a   burning   building you cant linger especially if your physical performance is   literally cut in half     I am praying for these two--and the russians--and  its hard to think f   anything else as they progress home mumbling step by step I have   messages   from their wives but they are unable to process spoken language at this   point Even if they get down i wonder what the results will be Its   really   sad I am sure they are also severely dehydrated--ill explain the process   when i get home but siffice to say you literally cant boil water fast   enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude My heartbeat at top camp   was 180 when i was resting in my sleeping bag before the attempt My   tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids   coming at a rate of a liter an hour doing nothing     I feel lucky today Very lucky When i think of my own descent alone   throwing up along the way yesterday i realize just how razor-thin this   whole thing is There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my   jumar on a supposedly new rope ony to reach the anchor point to find a   ten-year-old knot totally fried by the uv rays Other times i stepped in   snow footprints and slipped sliding down on my stomach until the rope   jerked taut Too many ways to die hereThe aussie who gave me his water in   the bowl may have prevented another casualty Whos to say Problem here   is   that unlike the events were used to when we sprint to the finish line   we   used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the   finish you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the   mountain And its so hard to do that Is a quarter tank enough Half Or   do   you need even more because in truth you are dying

spoke too soon       Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email Perspective comes   quickly   at 8000 meters and today thinking back on the ascent and all the rock   climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my   perpetually clumsy condition wrsened by AMS I am happy to be alive The   weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead   and   dying including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late   for   the north side By the time i am allowed to send this the media will have   already begun reporting on this tragedy I was slowed by my vomiting and   had   i continued i likely would have been trudging up with this group     In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends   ensuring   his safety so suz and i could take a vacation He is stuck on the ridge   now   dying and will likely be dead by morning One of our strongest guides is   with him and he too will probably die This guy is super strong but the   altitude has snatched him Were in shock here and can do nothing but   stare   into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight I have been   assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives   A   member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp 2 this morning 3   Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge and a spaniard is flirting   with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema despite Chris   Warners valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night When i   think of this mountain now i think only of death     Russ is quite experienced in hig-altitude rescues but this is the first   time   he has unleashed the team for our own It is a totaly professional   logistical operation locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up   into the jet stream relying heavily on the sherps who are just   incredibly   strong Many stories of heroism over last 24 hours and many to come The   guide and the client spent the night on the ridge 8650 meters   incoherent   and immobile freezing but they were saved when Asmus turned around from   a   desperate stumble home climbed the second step brutal for the second   time   in 10 hours and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark   Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes   reaching   top camp 8300 metersstill incredibly dangerous at 1130 pm It was a   relatively warm night just belowand both client and guide were seen   moving   space blankets this morning through the telescope Alive But they could   not   stand One could not see No comms Bivouacs above 8000 meters are epics   and   you are sure to read about this     Coordinating therescue from the Col Russ then rousted all available   bodies   and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days Purba   and   Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone humping oxygen The   American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up   their summit attempt remember they failed last week and also failed in   99   so this is a huge sacrifice to make the rescue It looked bleak this   morning but after some injections our teammates began to move carried by   the strong Americans As i type they have been moving at a snails pace   and   the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselvesWe hope our   sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be   an   absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue Remember that ridge is   14   inches across for stretches dropping 10000 feet on either side When i   gazed down 2 nights ago it was truly like staring out of the window of a   plane so steep was the drop The sherps are going to have to be supermen     From the ridge and high camp chris and asmus theyve been wasting there   for over 36 hours now have been gathering oxygen for the 2000 meter   descent   to ABC They are sucking some themselves to ensure we dont have a   double-rescue Im feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help   with the rescue assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive Too high   for a helo on this side so well have to platoon them down asap Other   members who summitted earlier are still up too high too slow descending   from safe camps and i may help them down as well So i will not be back   by mem day--we have to get these people down     The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope sulking   and making occasional trips to the waste moraine The client was slower   and   slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field I thought uh   oh   Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold   and the guide was pursuaded by the client Soon russ was on the radio   screaming at the guide to drag the client down but the hour grew late and   suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap both men immobile   and nearly incoherent the guide kicking and draggin the client to no   avail Asmus was with them and performed valiantly as i mentioned but no   one was in a position to help At that height every second counts and the   other teams rushed past on their way to safety When you rush into a   burning   building you cant linger especially if your physical performance is   literally cut in half     I am praying for these two--and the russians--and  its hard to think f   anything else as they progress home mumbling step by step I have   messages   from their wives but they are unable to process spoken language at this   point Even if they get down i wonder what the results will be Its   really   sad I am sure they are also severely dehydrated--ill explain the process   when i get home but siffice to say you literally cant boil water fast   enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude My heartbeat at top camp   was 180 when i was resting in my sleeping bag before the attempt My   tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids   coming at a rate of a liter an hour doing nothing     I feel lucky today Very lucky When i think of my own descent alone   throwing up along the way yesterday i realize just how razor-thin this   whole thing is There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my   jumar on a supposedly new rope ony to reach the anchor point to find a   ten-year-old knot totally fried by the uv rays Other times i stepped in   snow footprints and slipped sliding down on my stomach until the rope   jerked taut Too many ways to die hereThe aussie who gave me his water in   the bowl may have prevented another casualty Whos to say Problem here   is   that unlike the events were used to when we sprint to the finish line   we   used to say in crew that the perfect race was when

and today thinking back on the ascent and all the rock   climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my   perpetually clumsy condition wrsened by AMS I am happy to be alive The   weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead   and   dying including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late   for   the north side By the time i am allowed to send this the media will have   already begun reporting on this tragedy I was slowed by my vomiting and   had   i continued i likely would have been trudging up with this group     In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends   ensuring   his safety so suz and i could take a vacation He is stuck on the ridge   now   dying and will likely be dead by morning One of our strongest guides is   with him and he too will probably die This guy is super strong but the   altitude has snatched him Were in shock here and can do nothing but   stare   into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight I have been   assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives   A   member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp 2 this morning 3   Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge and a spaniard is flirting   with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema despite Chris   Warners valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night When i   think of this mountain now i think only of death     Russ is quite experienced in hig-altitude rescues but this is the first   time   he has unleashed the team for our own It is a totaly professional   logistical operation locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up   into the jet stream relying heavily on the sherps who are just   incredibly   strong Many stories of heroism over last 24 hours and many to come The   guide and the client spent the night on the ridge 8650 meters   incoherent   and immobile freezing but they were saved when Asmus turned around from   a   desperate stumble home climbed the second step brutal for the second   time   in 10 hours and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark   Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes   reaching   top camp 8300 metersstill incredibly dangerous at 1130 pm It was a   relatively warm night just belowand both client and guide were seen   moving   space blankets this morning through the telescope Alive But they could   not   stand One could not see No comms Bivouacs above 8000 meters are epics   and   you are sure to read about this     Coordinating therescue from the Col Russ then rousted all available   bodies   and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days Purba   and   Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone humping oxygen The   American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up   their summit attempt remember they failed last week and also failed in   99   so this is a huge sacrifice to make the rescue It looked bleak this   morning but after some injections our teammates began to move carried by   the strong Americans As i type they have been moving at a snails pace   and   the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselvesWe hope our   sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be   an   absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue Remember that ridge is   14   inches across for stretches dropping 10000 feet on either side When i   gazed down 2 nights ago it was truly like staring out of the window of a   plane so steep was the drop The sherps are going to have to be supermen     From the ridge and high camp chris and asmus theyve been wasting there   for over 36 hours now have been gathering oxygen for the 2000 meter   descent   to ABC They are sucking some themselves to ensure we dont have a   double-rescue Im feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help   with the rescue assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive Too high   for a helo on this side so well have to platoon them down asap Other   members who summitted earlier are still up too high too slow descending   from safe camps and i may help them down as well So i will not be back   by mem day--we have to get these people down     The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope sulking   and making occasional trips to the waste moraine The client was slower   and   slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field I thought uh   oh   Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold   and the guide was pursuaded by the client Soon russ was on the radio   screaming at the guide to drag the client down but the hour grew late and   suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap both men immobile   and nearly incoherent the guide kicking and draggin the client to no   avail Asmus was with them and performed valiantly as i mentioned but no   one was in a position to help At that height every second counts and the   other teams rushed past on their way to safety When you rush into a   burning   building you cant linger especially if your physical performance is   literally cut in half     I am praying for these two--and the russians--and  its hard to think f   anything else as they progress home mumbling step by step I have   messages   from their wives but they are unable to process spoken language at this   point Even if they get down i wonder what the results will be Its   really   sad I am sure they are also severely dehydrated--ill explain the process   when i get home but siffice to say you literally cant boil water fast   enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude My heartbeat at top camp   was 180 when i was resting in my sleeping bag before the attempt My   tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids   coming at a rate of a liter an hour doing nothing     I feel lucky today Very lucky When i think of my own descent alone   throwing up along the way yesterday i realize just how razor-thin this   whole thing is There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my   jumar on a supposedly new rope ony to reach the anchor point to find a   ten-year-old knot totally fried by the uv rays Other times i stepped in   snow footprints and slipped sliding down on my stomach until the rope   jerked taut Too many ways to die hereThe aussie who gave me his water in   the bowl may have prevented another casualty Whos to say Problem here   is   that unlike the events were used to when we sprint to the finish line   we   used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the   finish you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the   mountain And its so hard to do that Is a quarter tank enough Half Or   do   you need even more because in truth you are dying from the moment you   leave camp 3 not even top camp     I will pass this info only when the word is

and today thinking back on the ascent and all the rock   climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my   perpetually clumsy condition wrsened by AMS I am happy to be alive The   weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead   and   dying including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late   for   the north side By the time i am allowed to send this the media will have   already begun reporting on this tragedy I was slowed by my vomiting and   had   i continued i likely would have been trudging up with this group     In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends   ensuring   his safety so suz and i could take a vacation He is stuck on the ridge   now   dying and will likely be dead by morning One of our strongest guides is   with him and he too will probably die This guy is super strong but the   altitude has snatched him Were in shock here and can do nothing but   stare   into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight I have been   assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives   A   member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp 2 this morning 3   Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge and a spaniard is flirting   with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema despite Chris   Warners valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night When i   think of this mountain now i think only of death     Russ is quite experienced in hig-altitude rescues but this is the first   time   he has unleashed the team for our own It is a totaly professional   logistical operation locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up   into the jet stream relying heavily on the sherps who are just   incredibly   strong Many stories of heroism over last 24 hours and many to come The   guide and the client spent the night on the ridge 8650 meters   incoherent   and immobile freezing but they were saved when Asmus turned around from   a   desperate stumble home climbed the second step brutal for the second   time   in 10 hours and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark   Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes   reaching   top camp 8300 metersstill incredibly dangerous at 1130 pm It was a   relatively warm night just belowand both client and guide were seen   moving   space blankets this morning through the telescope Alive But they could   not   stand One could not see No comms Bivouacs above 8000 meters are epics   and   you are sure to read about this     Coordinating therescue from the Col Russ then rousted all available   bodies   and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days Purba   and   Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone humping oxygen The   American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up   their summit attempt remember they failed last week and also failed in   99   so this is a huge sacrifice to make the rescue It looked bleak this   morning but after some injections our teammates began to move carried by   the strong Americans As i type they have been moving at a snails pace   and   the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselvesWe hope our   sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be   an   absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue Remember that ridge is   14   inches across for stretches dropping 10000 feet on either side When i   gazed down 2 nights ago it was truly like staring out of the window of a   plane so steep was the drop The sherps are going to have to be supermen     From the ridge and high camp chris and asmus theyve been wasting there   for over 36 hours now have been gathering oxygen for the 2000 meter   descent   to ABC They are sucking some themselves to ensure we dont have a   double-rescue Im feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help   with the rescue assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive Too high   for a helo on this side so well have to platoon them down asap Other   members who summitted earlier are still up too high too slow descending   from safe camps and i may help them down as well So i will not be back   by mem day--we have to get these people down     The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope sulking   and making occasional trips to the waste moraine The client was slower   and   slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field I thought uh   oh   Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold   and the guide was pursuaded by the client Soon russ was on the radio   screaming at the guide to drag the client down but the hour grew late and   suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap both men immobile   and nearly incoherent the guide kicking and draggin the client to no   avail Asmus was with them and performed valiantly as i mentioned but no   one was in a position to help At that height every second counts and the   other teams rushed past on their way to safety When you rush into a   burning   building you cant linger especially if your physical performance is   literally cut in half     I am praying for these two--and the russians--and  its hard to think f   anything else as they progress home mumbling step by step I have   messages   from their wives but they are unable to process spoken language at this   point Even if they get down i wonder what the results will be Its   really   sad I am sure they are also severely dehydrated--ill explain the process   when i get home but siffice to say you literally cant boil water fast   enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude My heartbeat at top camp   was 180 when i was resting in my sleeping bag before the attempt My   tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids   coming at a rate of a liter an hour doing nothing     I feel lucky today Very lucky When i think of my own descent alone   throwing up along the way yesterday i realize just how razor-thin this   whole thing is There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my   jumar on a supposedly new rope ony to reach the anchor point to find a   ten-year-old knot totally fried by the uv rays Other times i stepped in   snow footprints and slipped sliding down on my stomach until the rope   jerked taut Too many ways to die hereThe aussie who gave me his water in   the bowl may have prevented another casualty Whos to say Problem here   is   that unlike the events were used to when we sprint to the finish line   we   used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the   finish you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the   mountain And its so hard to do

Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email Perspective comes   quickly   at 8000 meters and today thinking back on the ascent and all the rock   climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my   perpetually clumsy condition wrsened by AMS I am happy to be alive The   weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead   and   dying including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late   for   the north side By the time i am allowed to send this the media will have   already begun reporting on this tragedy I was slowed by my vomiting and   had   i continued i likely would have been trudging up with this group     In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends   ensuring   his safety so suz and i could take a vacation He is stuck on the ridge   now   dying and will likely be dead by morning One of our strongest guides is   with him and he too will probably die This guy is super strong but the   altitude has snatched him Were in shock here and can do nothing but   stare   into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight I have been   assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young wives   A   member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp 2 this morning 3   Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge and a spaniard is flirting   with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema despite Chris   Warners valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night When i   think of this mountain now i think only of death     Russ is quite experienced in hig-altitude rescues but this is the first   time   he has unleashed the team for our own It is a totaly professional   logistical operation locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up   into the jet stream relying heavily on the sherps who are just   incredibly   strong Many stories of heroism over last 24 hours and many to come The   guide and the client spent the night on the ridge 8650 meters   incoherent   and immobile freezing but they were saved when Asmus turned around from   a   desperate stumble home climbed the second step brutal for the second   time   in 10 hours and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before dark   Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes   reaching   top camp 8300 metersstill incredibly dangerous at 1130 pm It was a   relatively warm night just belowand both client and guide were seen   moving   space blankets this morning through the telescope Alive But they could   not   stand One could not see No comms Bivouacs above 8000 meters are epics   and   you are sure to read about this     Coordinating therescue from the Col Russ then rousted all available   bodies   and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days Purba   and   Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone humping oxygen The   American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up   their summit attempt remember they failed last week and also failed in   99   so this is a huge sacrifice to make the rescue It looked bleak this   morning but after some injections our teammates began to move carried by   the strong Americans As i type they have been moving at a snails pace   and   the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselvesWe hope our   sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be   an   absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue Remember that ridge is   14   inches across for stretches dropping 10000 feet on either side When i   gazed down 2 nights ago it was truly like staring out of the window of a   plane so steep was the drop The sherps are going to have to be supermen     From the ridge and high camp chris and asmus theyve been wasting there   for over 36 hours now have been gathering oxygen for the 2000 meter   descent   to ABC They are sucking some themselves to ensure we dont have a   double-rescue Im feeling better and i may be going up to the col to help   with the rescue assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive Too high   for a helo on this side so well have to platoon them down asap Other   members who summitted earlier are still up too high too slow descending   from safe camps and i may help them down as well So i will not be back   by mem day--we have to get these people down     The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope sulking   and making occasional trips to the waste moraine The client was slower   and   slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field I thought uh   oh   Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken hold   and the guide was pursuaded by the client Soon russ was on the radio   screaming at the guide to drag the client down but the hour grew late and   suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap both men immobile   and nearly incoherent the guide kicking and draggin the client to no   avail Asmus was with them and performed valiantly as i mentioned but no   one was in a position to help At that height every second counts and the   other teams rushed past on their way to safety When you rush into a   burning   building you cant linger especially if your physical performance is   literally cut in half     I am praying for these two--and the russians--and  its hard to think f   anything else as they progress home mumbling step by step I have   messages   from their wives but they are unable to process spoken language at this   point Even if they get down i wonder what the results will be Its   really   sad I am sure they are also severely dehydrated--ill explain the process   when i get home but siffice to say you literally cant boil water fast   enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude My heartbeat at top camp   was 180 when i was resting in my sleeping bag before the attempt My   tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids   coming at a rate of a liter an hour doing nothing     I feel lucky today Very lucky When i think of my own descent alone   throwing up along the way yesterday i realize just how razor-thin this   whole thing is There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my   jumar on a supposedly new rope ony to reach the anchor point to find a   ten-year-old knot totally fried by the uv rays Other times i stepped in   snow footprints and slipped sliding down on my stomach until the rope   jerked taut Too many ways to die hereThe aussie who gave me his water in   the bowl may have prevented another casualty Whos to say Problem here   is   that unlike the events were used to when we sprint to the finish line   we   used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at the   finish you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the   mountain And its so hard to do that Is a quarter tank enough Half Or   do   you need even more because in truth you are dying from the moment you   leave camp 3 not even top camp     I will pass this info only when the word is out--sorry--but will keep you   updated from there once i talk ro russ Its hard watching friends
