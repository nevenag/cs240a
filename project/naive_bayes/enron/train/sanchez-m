This email just came in today.  One of our brokers from New York has a brother in-law who just summited Everest yesterday at 10eastern.  There is a west gas trader that works in new york that is writing the account below.  Apparently there was a drastic change in the elements and several are already dead and there is a major rescue underway.  I haven't even found anything on this yet on the internet, though i expect there will be news shortly.  I thought you all would be moved by this account.

Made the ganache last night...tastes great...do you glaze it on the cake or frost the cake?  It said frosting..but to me it looked glazeable.
Ran to make a cake during lunch to pick up last few things.  What do you think about baking 2 12x2 cakes in one oven at the same time...staggering the pans?  I was wondering if it wouldn't bring down the oven temp because it might interfere with the air circulation in the oven.  Oh well...not sure what I'm going to do.  My plan is to bake the cakes tonight.  Everything is already measured.  I am crossing my fingers that my oven doesn't wig out.....last night it did when i was making financiers.......my oven is very temperamental...though it has been good lately.  Talk to you soon.

For the engine cake do you use the recipe for the ganache on there or a
different one?
I was planning on trying their recipe.
Tonight i'm going to measure out everything.  I'll keep you updated.

Hey there,

Mom, can you forward this on to David.

I am going to forward you our flight itenary from home this weekend.  We leave at 9:30am on sunday.  We are going to go into Columbus sat morning and then will stop by David's on Saturday to prep the yard and set up any necessary stuff for the dogs.  We will drop the dogs off though on Sunday morning very early.  I don't want to leave them there overnight for the first night by themselves...though usually they are fine to stay by themselves...I just want to make sure that the yard will be secure.  

The company we are going with is called Alaska Discovery.  Their website is www.akdiscovery.com  .  We will be staying at their inn on the days prior and after our actual expedition.  The trip we are doing is called the Glacier Bay Expedition....trip start date being the 11th.  On the 19th we fly back to seattle and will have to stay there overnight.  Our return flight to Houston is wed the 20th at 6ish in the morning and we will both be coming into work when we get in.  We will pick up the dogs that evening.

I am going to leave David my cell phone bc the tags on the dogs have that phone number on it.  To get into the voice mail just dial the phone number  713-516-0651 ....and the password is 1743.  The dogs eat together and share 1 1/2 coffee cans full of dog food once a day.  They eat in the evening.  Pearl takes medication twice a day and one of them is supposed to be taken with food.  We usually just give her a few treats in the am with the pill.  We will leave treats along with the food.  

I think that is about it.  Thanks again for taking care of the dogs.  We really appreciate it.  I will call before and after we are in the woods to check up on things and we will pick them up wednesday evening.

Talk to you later.  Mom, John and I will come by before we leave.  Probably Saturday evening.

Just spoke with Rebecca...the guys wife.  She says he has a grandfather clock repair tonight to do....not sure if 7 will work.  I told her we had just wanted to check it out while it was still daylight outside.  She is going to phone her hubby and get back with me.  I also gave her your name and cell phone.  She said that this truck is her husbands "baby" and it is breaking his heart to get rid.  Thats a good sign.  I'll talk to you later.

Hey there,
No apologies necessary.  Actually yesterday I was knee deep in strawberry jam.  I spent a great part of the afternoon tied up with that at home.  Made 12 jars and they go fast...I may do some more canning this weekend.  
Friday sounds great....just let me know what time.  Take care and talk to you soon,
Mo.

Monique,

I really wanted to spend some time talking with you this past weekend but
with the bachelor party I was involved with, it was impossible to fit it
in.  And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels.  The
most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun and
you always have intelligent things to say.  At a different level, I think
you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value you
what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm very
good at yet.  And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what is
happening in your life and how you are doing?  I know there are things
going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to
hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help.

You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a strange
way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are
troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well
through email.  Maybe we could grab a beer on Friday afternoon like last
time at the Ale House (I'll be in town).  Let me know if you are available,
respond by email when you can

Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon,

joe

Hey there,

Did you call me at the Derby?  I have some vague recollection of getting a voice mail from you...however i had many many mint juleps and was very intoxicated.  I actually flew in on saturday and out sunday morning....was maybe there 16hrs tops.
Anyway,  I guess you were here this weekend.  Hope everything went well.  Give me a call anytime if you'd like to talk.  I will be home solo for the next 3 weekends....great time to chit chat.  Hopefully will talk to you soon.
Take care,
Mo.

actually i forgot that fri is the first day of bid week which is a basically the 3 busiest business days of the month....when the nymex contract expires for june. anyways, it may be hard for me to commit to a time to get out of here and i think 330 might be early.  i will be in town the entire weekend and i have pretty much nothing on my plate, except make jam.  i know you are probably very busy so is there a better time for you?  we'll figure something out.

Hey there,
No apologies necessary.  Actually yesterday I was knee deep in strawberry
jam.  I spent a great part of the afternoon tied up with that at home.
Made 12 jars and they go fast...I may do some more canning this weekend.
Friday sounds great....just let me know what time.  Take care and talk to
you soon,
Mo.

   Monique,

   I really wanted to spend some time talking with you this past weekend
   but
   with the bachelor party I was involved with, it was impossible to fit it
   in.  And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels.  The
   most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun
   and
   you always have intelligent things to say.  At a different level, I
   think
   you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value
   you
   what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm
   very
   good at yet.  And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what
   is
   happening in your life and how you are doing?  I know there are things
   going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to
   hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help.

   You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a
   strange
   way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are
   troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well
   through email.  Maybe we could grab a beer on Friday afternoon like last
   time at the Ale House (I'll be in town).  Let me know if you are
   available,
   respond by email when you can

   Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon,

   joe

I'll prep it when I get home and you can blacken it when you get in.
Should we serve it with wild rice or the sweet potato?

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

I exercised my options today...for various reasons.

First: stock moved around 1.3 yesterday and was up as high as 1.5 today...now on its way back down.  I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.

Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably going to move back down.

Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee "consumer" confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly dissapating.

Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy money....I can always take the money market and get back in enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.

OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if that market continues to trend up.

So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever written.

Hey there,

I have a broker dinner on thurs.  These things can drag out...so I'm not sure I'll be able to stop by.
Best of luck in school.  I enjoyed hanging out with you the short time we knew each other.  Forward me your new email address when you get one.  I'll write you if I take the plunge and reverse the long trading/short cooking spread.  Who knows.
Take care,

Dear Friends and Colleagues,


It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chance to say goodbye.  

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!


Brian

Bear Destroyed after Fatal Attack in Canada 
Compiled by Outside Online
June 6, 2001 A black bear that attacked and killed a camper in Canada's Northwest Territories was shot yesterday by wildlife officials, according to press reports. 

Coroners determined that the bear shot yesterday was the same animal that mauled 18-year-old Kyle Harry on Saturday while he was camping with friends near Yellowknife. The bear had been shot by a RCMP officer at the scene of the attack on Saturday and a necropsy uncovered bullet fragments in the bear's chest that matched the type of bullet used by the officer, a wildlife official told the London Free Press. 

Harry and five other teens had camped overnight on Friday before four members of the group left early on Saturday morning, the London Free Press reports. Harry and a 14-year-old girl stayed behind and saw the bear come into their campground around noon. They pulled their food inside of their tent then later made a break for a ridge after the bear approached the tent. The girl was able to escape and get to the road where she was taken to the hospital by a passing car. Harry, caught by the bear as he ascended the ridge, was found dead by officials. A report yesterday by The Outdoor Network says the bear was feeding on Harry when officials arrived. 

On Sunday police and wildlife officials launched an intensive search for the animal, employing a helicopter and infrared scanner. Another bear shot on Monday was determined not be the one responsible for the attack. 

On July 2 of last year, 24-year-old Canadian biathlete Mary-Beth Miller was killed by a black bear while on a training run at the Myriam Bedard Biathlon Centre near Quebec City.

Mom,
I know you are really strapped to find people to take care of granny on the weekends and i know the costs are adding up as well.  But, if you find someone who can come on saturday or sundays for the day or even for a few hours on a weekly basis i can help pay for that expense.  With the weather improving,  I think it would be good for your stress to be able to get out in the morning and go to the park and just walk the memorial loop and be oustide.  Do you think Robin could come for a few hrs on sat or sunday mornings?  We could meet at the park, David could meet us as well.  I do have a few trips planned for the near future, but I would be very happy to meet you at the park to go walking or at Hanks when I am in town.  I would not be able to cope well with the stress of my job without the outlet of going to the gym or the park to work things out..  Let me know how I can help.

Subject:	Interesting Day


Went to the doctor this morning.  Was telling him about the mild chest pain
(over the left side) that have been coming on and lasting no more than 5
minutes. Told him I have been under a hugh amount of stress for quite a long
time and that I thought that could very well be the problem.  After giving
him the wonderful health history of both maternal/paternal side, he decided
to do an ECG and complete blood work.
	 ECG states an "abnormal ECG -- non-specific T wave abnormality".  I
will have to read about the T wave.  My blood pressure was 178.  Never
before that it ever been over 110/80.
	I am now waiting for referral approval for both a Stress Test at St.
Lukes and a bone density/mammogram at St. Joseph.
	I feel confident that everything is allright, but I thought just in
case I should keep both of you posted.

May invite Keith and Tracy...he wants to check out our house/neighborhood.
May even invite Dennis from cooking school and his wife since they live close by...hmmmm
this could get a bit large..which is not to bad....we could set up horseshoes in the front yard...that would be fun.
We'll talk more tonight and construct an email......Based on our headcount we can figure out what the best food is to fix and then possible divy up some of the bringins.

Hey,

Yes, I tried calling on Saturday night but you must have already been mint
juleped (if that is a verb...you tell me?)  I actually did not make it down
this weekend...forgot it was Mother's Day so I stayed here and did the
brunch thing with Mom and Grandma in Connecticut, will be coming down on
Memorial Day Weekend so maybe we can say hello then.

I'll try calling you this weekend anyway and we can swap our relationship
stories.  Glad you had a good time in Kentucky and you made it home safely.
Talk to you soon...promise.

Hey there,

Did you call me at the Derby?  I have some vague recollection of getting a
voice mail from you...however i had many many mint juleps and was very
intoxicated.  I actually flew in on saturday and out sunday morning....was
maybe there 16hrs tops.
Anyway,  I guess you were here this weekend.  Hope everything went well.
Give me a call anytime if you'd like to talk.  I will be home solo for the
next 3 weekends....great time to chit chat.  Hopefully will talk to you
soon.
Take care,

Hey Mo.  I got the final email on my positions and it looks like I bought a tiny bit too much Q3 san juan at -74 on my last click.  Would you mind just transferring the scraps back into your book?  I think it's literally about 250/mm a day -- you can see it on tds.  Thanks again.

Yes and no.
I think in many ways he is very similar to us.  This is the lifestyle he has always led since college.  To settle down and lay roots somewhere is something that I know from talking with him pulls at his conscience often, that he wants at many levels....but is unfamiliar and therefore scary for him to consider doing.  

Just like our desire to live that kind of lifestyle...seemingly free, having only enough money to get you to the next destination...is extinguished by our practicality about things like retirement...providing for a family...and having money to do things that require money to do like ski trips, alaska, etc.

I think this just goes to show how difficult it is to make major lifestyle changes that go against years of living and thinking differently.  Not just adapting to new creature comforts but changing one's mindset...which is scary...and difficult.  

More than you bargained for in a response eh? 
We are leaving here at 11ish..the flight leaves at 1pm.  I'll give you a call before we board the plane.
L-mo.

well,
for those of you that thought i was sticking around portland....uh, psyche!
just kidding...uh, whoops!

actually, portland was great.  i plan on returning there post-summer to
give it another go...hopefully with more money in the account for those
financial droughts.  unless of course a climbing trip to thailand happens
to come up!!!!!

as for now...stop sending all those letters to portland and just change the
address to minnesota.  as always, cookies and chocolate are always welcome.

PO Box 450, Spruce Road
c/o VOBS
Ely, MN 55731-0450
218-365-5761 office

here i shall reside with the bugs and anything else that'll try to crawl
into my sleeping bag.  i will be here from the 11th of may until the end of
august.  email is still prob'ly the best way to get a hold of me.  by the
time i get there, i'll have a new cell # so you can leave voice mails
anytime, otherwise you can usually leave messages on the office phone.

in case that itch to travel gets to you this summer and you find yourself
in the northwoods with no where to rest your weary head.....always know
that you can stop on by at a moments notice!

so until the next time, be well, smile plenty, and hug someone you  love.

off belay,

david

Yes, I do need to pack/start laundry.  I'm flex for dinner.  Two
suggestions:

1. Eggs and bacon (me)/biscuits (you).  Dishes (me).  Walk with dogs (us).
2. Meet at home, slip into our running gear, grab the dogs, and go to
Memorial for a jog.  Stop on the way home and pick something up for dinner
(veggies with tofu).

I was very worried last night.  David's note made it seem like something had happened.  I didn't know my phone was out.  I hardly use it...i'm really not a phone person.  But when I realized it was out yesterday...cingular was closed and i couldn't call.  John is getting in today.  I am doing a fun run tomorrow morning and we will be in the rest of the weekend.  I should get the phone taken care of later this afternoon.  This evening I have another broker dinner.  I will try to call before I got to that.   Talk to you later.

This email just came in today.  One of our brokers from New York has a brother in-law who just summited Everest yesterday at 10eastern.  There is a west gas trader that works in new york that is writing the account below.  Apparently there was a drastic change in the elements and several are already dead and there is a major rescue underway.  I haven't even found anything on this yet on the internet, though i expect there will be news shortly.  I thought you all would be moved by this account.

I got back form Germany on Friday and have been trying to catch up with work
before our trip to Alaska.  We leave this Sunday the 10th.  Monique's
brother is going to watch the dogs while we're gone so don't worry about it.
It sounds like you've got your hands full.

It's great you're buying a house.  We just can't seem to figure out what we
want to do.  Monique is so stressed out with work right now I'm not sure how
much longer we'll be in Houston.

Did you get a good loan?  Did you get your truck yet?

Hi Worm,

How's it going?  I haven't heard from you in awhile!!
What are the dates you are going to Alaska?
Did Mom tell you I am buying a house?
Well, I am.   And it is stressing me out!!!!!
I have two offers on the table right now.
Both of the houses are cute.  I just can't decide which one
I like better.  You need to come visit soon.  Hopefully,
I will be moved in when you bring Jake and Pearl up.
How is Mo?  How is work?  How are the dogs?
Let me know.
Love,
Jul

Hey there, 
haven't done the recipes yet. I'm actually planning on doing just the chocolate one.  I am going to do another cake that is a white chiffon cake w/ white choc buttercream frosting.  It also has the buttercream/fresh berrries/ and seedless jam in the layers.  I'll let you know how that turns out.
My plan is to do the frostings/ganache on monday..and bake the cakes on tuesday...assemble wednesday.  I've been wiggin out about it because I am doing this to feed 30 people and I have not been practicing at all.......But....i slapped myself around yesterday to calm down and i'm ready for it.  I will do all the measuring on sunday too..so i think i'm giving myself enough time.  Wish me luck.
By the way...I loved Make A Cake..AND they have those expensive silicone molds on sale from 67 to 40 each....i bought a financier mold.  The guy is getting rid of them because they don't sell.  You may want to pass this on to Dan.
I'll let you know how it goes.  John is joking with me by asking "When are the cakes due?"....like it is homework.
Talk to you soon,
Mo.

Subject:	Everest Tragedy

This email just came in today.  One of our brokers from New York has a brother in-law who just summited Everest yesterday at 10eastern.  There is a west gas trader that works in new york that is writing the account below.  Apparently there was a drastic change in the elements and several are already dead and there is a major rescue underway.  I haven't even found anything on this yet on the internet, though i expect there will be news shortly.  I thought you all would be moved by this account.

do that??

Hey there,
No apologies necessary.  Actually yesterday I was knee deep in strawberry
jam.  I spent a great part of the afternoon tied up with that at home.
Made 12 jars and they go fast...I may do some more canning this weekend.
Friday sounds great....just let me know what time.  Take care and talk to
you soon,
Mo.

   Monique,

   I really wanted to spend some time talking with you this past weekend
   but
   with the bachelor party I was involved with, it was impossible to fit it
   in.  And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels.  The
   most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun
   and
   you always have intelligent things to say.  At a different level, I
   think
   you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value
   you
   what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm
   very
   good at yet.  And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what
   is
   happening in your life and how you are doing?  I know there are things
   going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to
   hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help.

   You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a
   strange
   way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are
   troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well
   through email.  Maybe we could grab a beer on Friday afternoon like last
   time at the Ale House (I'll be in town).  Let me know if you are
   available,
   respond by email when you can

   Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon,

   joe

hey there,

this just in....we may all have var limits now....lavo imposed a million dollar fine on our group bc we exceeded var...of course we just exceeded it by 130k....you can imagine our reaction and the discourse....i'll let you know what comes out of that.

so it looks like you did no trades today.
your curve shift is -218.
mike went out w/ fixed price phys today.  it looks like elpo has picked city gate to manipulate this month....they are lifting the fixed price like it is going out of style.  june basis at the cg ran.
the juan cash today was mostly given.....i think matt was able to cover stuff pretty quickly...and with no fluff...ha ha

i guess that is about it.  aga was 118...with 110 being our expectation.  the screen fell a bit as a result

we have prebid today.  hope you feel well.  talk to ya later.
attached are just the curves since your positions are unch.

later,
Mo

well,
for those of you that thought i was sticking around portland....uh, psyche!
just kidding...uh, whoops!
 
actually, portland was great.  i plan on returning there post-summer to give it another go...hopefully with more money in the account for those financial droughts.  unless of course a climbing trip to thailand happens to come up!!!!!
 
as for now...stop sending all those letters to portland and just change the address to minnesota.  as always, cookies and chocolate are always welcome.
 
PO Box 450, Spruce Road
c/o VOBS
Ely, MN 55731-0450
218-365-5761 office
 
here i shall reside with the bugs and anything else that'll try to crawl into my sleeping bag.  i will be here from the 11th of may until the end of august.  email is still prob'ly the best way to get a hold of me.  by the time i get there, i'll have a new cell # so you can leave voice mails anytime, otherwise you can usually leave messages on the office phone.
 
in case that itch to travel gets to you this summer and you find yourself  in the northwoods with no where to rest your weary head.....always know that you can stop on by at a moments notice!
 
so until the next time, be well, smile plenty, and hug someone you  love.
 
off belay,
 
david

Yo!
Yes, I believe your typical campells will have little mushroom pieces in it.  And kmart would be a good place to buy a pyrex dish (glass baking)....of course you could borrow any supplies from me any time.  Are you cooking up some grub for a lil lady???
I heard you all had a great time.  Saw the pic of you that john said you "woke up" for at the brewery.  Maybe we all can get together for a brew before john and i are off for alaska on sunday.  we will be gone for a week and a half.  Maybe friday after work.
Let me know if you have any other cooking q's.
Mo

Things are fine.  I am getting thru a cold right now.....kind of on a plate=

 here to do the boxing workout with me on saturday.  I am planning on makin=
g strawberry jam either on sat afternoon/evening or sunday.  Otherwise I wa=
s just planning on reading, organizing some of my desk items, and tackling =
the spare bedroom once and for all.  I am really strapped for clothes space=
 and the spare bedroom usually ends up a mess.  Maybe I can come by on sat =
early evening and we can fix dinner.  Maybe bring over a movie?  Just shoot=
 me an email.  I will be in tomorrow but we usually head out of here on fri=
days early...around 3 or 4.
Talk to you later.

Yes and no.
I think in many ways he is very similar to us.  This is the lifestyle he has always led since college.  To settle down and lay roots somewhere is something that I know from talking with him pulls at his conscience often, that he wants at many levels....but is unfamiliar and therefore scary for him to consider doing.  

Just like our desire to live that kind of lifestyle...seemingly free, having only enough money to get you to the next destination...is extinguished by our practicality about things like retirement...providing for a family...and having money to do things that require money to do like ski trips, alaska, etc.

I think this just goes to show how difficult it is to make major lifestyle changes that go against years of living and thinking differently.  Not just adapting to new creature comforts but changing one's mindset...which is scary...and difficult.  

More than you bargained for in a response eh? 
We are leaving here at 11ish..the flight leaves at 1pm.  I'll give you a call before we board the plane.
L-mo.

well,
for those of you that thought i was sticking around portland....uh, psyche!
just kidding...uh, whoops!

actually, portland was great.  i plan on returning there post-summer to
give it another go...hopefully with more money in the account for those
financial droughts.  unless of course a climbing trip to thailand happens
to come up!!!!!

as for now...stop sending all those letters to portland and just change the
address to minnesota.  as always, cookies and chocolate are always welcome.

PO Box 450, Spruce Road

Ely, MN 55731-0450
218-365-5761 office

here i shall reside with the bugs and anything else that'll try to crawl
into my sleeping bag.  i will be here from the 11th of may until the end of
august.  email is still prob'ly the best way to get a hold of me.  by the
time i get there, i'll have a new cell # so you can leave voice mails
anytime, otherwise you can usually leave messages on the office phone.

in case that itch to travel gets to you this summer and you find yourself
in the northwoods with no where to rest your weary head.....always know
that you can stop on by at a moments notice!

so until the next time, be well, smile plenty, and hug someone you  love.

off belay,

Subject: options exercised

I exercised my options today...for various reasons.

First: stock moved around 1.3 yesterday and was up as high as 1.5
today...now on its way back down.  I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i
really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.

Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were
selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to
enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron
Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was
released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India
deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably
going to move back down.

Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee
"consumer" confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see
many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and
the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly
dissapating.

Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price
levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy
money....I can always take the money market and get back in
enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but
the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few
thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite
uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.

OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if
that market continues to trend up.

So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever
written.
Talk to you later hun

We should talk soon and it actually won't be that long before I come into
town again.  I'll be down the weekend of May 12 that Thursday night and
nothing would make me happier than to spend a chunk of the afternoon at The
Ale House again.  A few beers always helps these kinds of conversations
because they are difficult emotional things to think about and that is best
done if you are willing to let your guard down.  I have been thinking a lot
about my relationship and what it means to me and I would love to share if
you are willing to listen.  You haven't slowed the traveling down at all I
see...all I claim in terms of travel are weekly trips to lovely suburban
New Jersey.  Enjoy the Derby (if it wasn't this past weekend and I'll talk
to you soon)

peace, love and flowers

Hey there,
I would love to have more deep conversations on these topics.  Maybe we can
schedule a long phone call sometime since i'm sure it will be a while
before you come in.  I am so bad about answering my phone in the
evenings...i just shut down shop when i go home....but we should definitely
talk.  I'm interested in hearing about you as well.  From our talk last
time it seems we may have some of the same dilemmas.  I've got a trip
coming up to the Kentucky derby next weekend...was in vegas last
weekend....but will be around here until mid june when john and I go to
alaska.  I am slightly ready to slow down now...way too much travel...john
and i need to spend more quality time together.  I don't know how you do
the long distance relationship..it would be very hard for me.  I guess I
crave more constant attention--high maintenance---Ha!  Kidding.  Anyway, it
is always great to hear from you.  Hopefully we can talk soon.
Take care,
Mo.

How the hell is my globe-trotting, beach combing, vacation taking, cake
baking, food preparing, favorite Enron employee?  I promised i wasn't going
to let you go another 12 months before i talked to you again and i'm
keeping my word.  We have a lot still to talk about in line with the
conversation we had at the Ale House...you know, good times, good friends,
good beer and deep conversation about love, career, marriage and what we do
with our lives.  Respond when you can and I hope all is well with you.

Talk to you soon,

2-12" cakes may work ok but you might swap the positions about half way
through the cooking time.I'm pretty sure it will take longer than the
prescribed time but it will work. To acurately test them,touch the top of
each layer.If the finger marks bounce back you're there.If they remain
indented.bake a little longer.Perhaps 2 minutes at a time.If you have any
pressing issues call my cell(713-725-2676) Good luck    Den

Monique,

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you before now and I truly wish we could've
gotten together over Memorial Day.  I was only in town a couple of days and
then off to San Antonio so we just missed each other again.  Go a lot to
catch up on and I am going to be tenacious in my attempts to get a hold of
you...let me know when you have time to talk.  I am out this weekend but
maybe tonight or next week, we can chat.  Let me know.

Take care and stay safe.

joe

This email just came in today.  One of our brokers from New York has a brother in-law who just summited Everest yesterday at 10eastern.  There is a west gas trader that works in new york that is writing the account below.  Apparently there was a drastic change in the elements and several are already dead and there is a major rescue underway.  I haven't even found anything on this yet on the internet, though i expect there will be news shortly.  I thought you all would be moved by this account.

I'm glad you remembered my email.  Glad to see you too.  Now that I have your email you are sure to get the invite for next years partyI actually ran into Anthony Magdaleno about 2 weeks ago.  Do you know him?  He was in the same volunteer group w/ Monica and I.
I think we are going to meet up at woodrows again this friday.  I like the location....and some different faces as well as opposed to the kirby crowd.
I work on the west gas trading desk here at enron....if you have friends who work in gas as well, perhaps i know them.  Of course this place is like A&M....huge.  Take care and hopefully we'll see each other out again. Say hello to Monica for me.  Maybe we can meet up sometime after work for drinks.

Melba,

Mike is interested in putting out some of our west eol products on a 24 basis, similar to the nymex desk.  However, we would like more information on how this would work and  what kinds of controls are available for products to shut off automatically.  If you have time today, perhaps you could swing by our desk and give us more information.  Sometime in the afternoon would be great for us.
Let me know.
Thanks,
Monique

Todd is trying to reserve a large (sleeps 16 comfortably) cabin on Lake
Travis around the 4th of July holiday.  The 4th is on a Wednesday this year
so he'll probably reserve it through the proceeding or following weekend.
I'm just trying to get a head count for now so anyone interested please let
me know.

We rented this place a couple years ago and had a great time.  It's located
on the lake and has a private boat dock.  Todd will most likely have his
boat for skiing and cruising the lake.  Other activities include Jet Ski
rental, wind surfing rental, sun bathing, cooking out, and drinking.

I guess the next thing we would need to find out is how many people would be

how many of the folks in H-town would be interested and for what days?

   Sorry I haven't gotten back to you before now and I truly wish we
   could've
   gotten together over Memorial Day.  I was only in town a couple of days
   and
   then off to San Antonio so we just missed each other again.  Go a lot to

   maybe tonight or next week, we can chat.  Let me know.

   Take care and stay safe.

Hey,

Yes, I tried calling on Saturday night but you must have already been mint
juleped (if that is a verb...you tell me?)  I actually did not make it down
this weekend...forgot it was Mother's Day so I stayed here and did the
brunch thing with Mom and Grandma in Connecticut, will be coming down on
Memorial Day Weekend so maybe we can say hello then.

I'll try calling you this weekend anyway and we can swap our relationship
stories.  Glad you had a good time in Kentucky and you made it home safely.
Talk to you soon...promise.

Hey there,

Did you call me at the Derby?  I have some vague recollection of getting a
voice mail from you...however i had many many mint juleps and was very
intoxicated.  I actually flew in on saturday and out sunday morning....was
maybe there 16hrs tops.
Anyway,  I guess you were here this weekend.  Hope everything went well.
Give me a call anytime if you'd like to talk.  I will be home solo for the
next 3 weekends....great time to chit chat.  Hopefully will talk to you
soon.
Take care,
Mo.

        Weekend Update: Go easy on yourself and others Friday. Set aside ti=
ght schedules and worries. Take things as they come, without getting bogged=
 down in impossible expectations. Delays and adjustments are very likely. S=
aturday is excellent for making sense out of Friday's events. Calmly piece =
together fragments until they assume some sort of order. It is so important=
 that you consciously forgive those who have disappointed or inconvenienced=
 you or your loved ones. Hanging onto resentment will tear holes in your he=
art. Sunday brings bliss. Doubt is replaced with a comforting sense that al=
l will be fine in time. Private talks with loved ones bring healing and emo=
tional intimacy. In fact, you may experience a gratifying breakthrough in o=
ne of your most important relationships. Encourage your significant other t=
o relax, dream, and cultivate hope. Things will evolve in wondrous ways. Gr=
aciously accept the unasked for changes entering your life and let the tran=
sformation begin. . . .    =09

Thanks for the tickets.  We had a great time.  They were actually dead center of the covered area...perfect......and much better than the field considering the lightening storm and heavy downpour that lasted about an hr.   We even got sprayed by some bi-directional rain..it was wild.
Anyways, thanks again.

This email just came in today.  One of our brokers from New York has a brother in-law who just summited Everest yesterday at 10eastern.  There is a west gas trader that works in new york that is writing the account below.  Apparently there was a drastic change in the elements and several are already dead and there is a major rescue underway.  I haven't even found anything on this yet on the internet, though i expect there will be news shortly.  I thought you all would be moved by this account.

Made the ganache last night...tastes great...do you glaze it on the cake or frost the cake?  It said frosting..but to me it looked glazeable.
Ran to make a cake during lunch to pick up last few things.  What do you think about baking 2 12x2 cakes in one oven at the same time...staggering the pans?  I was wondering if it wouldn't bring down the oven temp because it might interfere with the air circulation in the oven.  Oh well...not sure what I'm going to do.  My plan is to bake the cakes tonight.  Everything is already measured.  I am crossing my fingers that my oven doesn't wig out.....last night it did when i was making financiers.......my oven is very temperamental...though it has been good lately.  Talk to you soon.
Mo.

Question:
For the engine cake do you use the recipe for the ganache on there or a
different one?
I was planning on trying their recipe.
Tonight i'm going to measure out everything.  I'll keep you updated.

Hey there,

Mom, can you forward this on to David.

I am going to forward you our flight itenary from home this weekend.  We leave at 9:30am on sunday.  We are going to go into Columbus sat morning and then will stop by David's on Saturday to prep the yard and set up any necessary stuff for the dogs.  We will drop the dogs off though on Sunday morning very early.  I don't want to leave them there overnight for the first night by themselves...though usually they are fine to stay by themselves...I just want to make sure that the yard will be secure.  

The company we are going with is called Alaska Discovery.  Their website is www.akdiscovery.com  .  We will be staying at their inn on the days prior and after our actual expedition.  The trip we are doing is called the Glacier Bay Expedition....trip start date being the 11th.  On the 19th we fly back to seattle and will have to stay there overnight.  Our return flight to Houston is wed the 20th at 6ish in the morning and we will both be coming into work when we get in.  We will pick up the dogs that evening.

I am going to leave David my cell phone bc the tags on the dogs have that phone number on it.  To get into the voice mail just dial the phone number  713-516-0651 ....and the password is 1743.  The dogs eat together and share 1 1/2 coffee cans full of dog food once a day.  They eat in the evening.  Pearl takes medication twice a day and one of them is supposed to be taken with food.  We usually just give her a few treats in the am with the pill.  We will leave treats along with the food.  

I think that is about it.  Thanks again for taking care of the dogs.  We really appreciate it.  I will call before and after we are in the woods to check up on things and we will pick them up wednesday evening.

Talk to you later.  Mom, John and I will come by before we leave.  Probably Saturday evening.

Just spoke with Rebecca...the guys wife.  She says he has a grandfather clock repair tonight to do....not sure if 7 will work.  I told her we had just wanted to check it out while it was still daylight outside.  She is going to phone her hubby and get back with me.  I also gave her your name and cell phone.  She said that this truck is her husbands "baby" and it is breaking his heart to get rid.  Thats a good sign.  I'll talk to you later.

Hey there,
No apologies necessary.  Actually yesterday I was knee deep in strawberry jam.  I spent a great part of the afternoon tied up with that at home.  Made 12 jars and they go fast...I may do some more canning this weekend.  
Friday sounds great....just let me know what time.  Take care and talk to you soon,
Mo.

Monique,

I really wanted to spend some time talking with you this past weekend but
with the bachelor party I was involved with, it was impossible to fit it
in.  And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels.  The
most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun and
you always have intelligent things to say.  At a different level, I think
you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value you
what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm very
good at yet.  And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what is
happening in your life and how you are doing?  I know there are things
going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to
hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help.

You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a strange
way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are
troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well
through email.  Maybe we could grab a beer on Friday afternoon like last
time at the Ale House (I'll be in town).  Let me know if you are available,
respond by email when you can

Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon,

joe

Hey there,

Did you call me at the Derby?  I have some vague recollection of getting a voice mail from you...however i had many many mint juleps and was very intoxicated.  I actually flew in on saturday and out sunday morning....was maybe there 16hrs tops.
Anyway,  I guess you were here this weekend.  Hope everything went well.  Give me a call anytime if you'd like to talk.  I will be home solo for the next 3 weekends....great time to chit chat.  Hopefully will talk to you soon.
Take care,
Mo.

I vaguely remember that.  How long ago was that?  When you were on Cheena? Or did you make it at my apt on Albans?

For some reason I was thinking of cake this morning and remembered the time
I made you a Betty Crooker special.  I laughed.
