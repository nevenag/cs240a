quietly been  removed The heady mix of  audacity ambition and arrogance revealed by the banners is as good a guide as  any to Enrons remarkable rise and fall Forged in the 1980s by the merger of  two troubled gas-pipeline firms Enron drove the development of the  sophisticated spot-and-derivatives markets in energy that it has come to  dominate Indeed such is the scale of its operations and its dealings with  many of the worlds financial institutions that some observers see parallels  with Long-Term Capital Management LTCM the hedge fund  that failed in 1998-and not just because seemingly brilliant financial  alchemists have been humbled Were Enron to go bust-unlikely but in the current  nervous climate not impossible-might a crisis ensue Troubles in Californias  politically crazed power market an ill-advised foray into telecoms bandwidth  trading and concerns about management badly dented Enrons share price earlier  this year prompting the departure of Jeffrey Skilling the firms newish chief  executive in August Kenneth Lay an avid free-marketeer friend of George Bush  and visionary chairman of the firm was obliged to resume hands-on control This has not slowed  Enrons decline Day by day it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial  quagmire that is largely of its own creation Not least thanks to its lack of  transparency the firms credibility with the markets has eroded to the point  that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread Enrons reputation for  financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its  third-quarter results came out in mid-October showing a 1 billion write-off on  water distribution broadband trading and other investments Worse disclosed  only in passing by Mr Lay in a conference call with analysts the firm suffered  a 12 billion reduction in capital stemming from a hedging deal with a related  private-equity fund called LJM The charge was due to  Enrons forced sale of 55m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound  this summer Almost nobody outside Enron had been aware of the terms of the deal  with LJM a structured finance vehicle Enrons failure to offer  details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear  the worst about its huge balance sheet Its shares plunged by 19 on October  30th alone see chart before recovering a bit the next day Andrew Fastow who was  replaced as chief financial officer on October 24th was a general partner in  LJM  Jeffrey McMahon his successor has much to do to  restore confidence Questions abound Were the trusts run at arms length What  did Mr Fastow earn from the partnership Ominously the Securities and Exchange  Commission SEC has now launched a formal  inquiry Moodys a rating  agency last week cut its rating on the companys debt to barely above junk  level Further downgrades might unleash claims from other off-balance-sheet  partnerships Those known about such as Atlantic Water and Marlin Water do not  seem big enough to bankrupt Enron but speculation is rife about what other  obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles A lower credit rating  could destroy Enrons core franchise as the leading energy middleman by scaring  away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets That might have nasty  consequences in other markets Enron acknowledges that it is a large participant  in the derivatives market holding a portfolio with a notional value of 21  billion Rightly or wrongly many traders believe that figure vastly understates  Enrons presence If the firms on the other side of Enrons trades start to fear  that payment is not coming they might curb their other trading producing a  knock-on effect Where this could end up is a subject of much  conjecture Utilities that trade  energy could be hit So could the commodity and derivative operations of large  commercial and investment banks The ties are notably tight between Enron and  JP Morgan Chase according to Ventana Capital a research firm Not only does  JP Morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for Enron it also  has the largest derivative operation of any bank as well as a large business  trading commodities There is no doubt that Enron is on the other side of many  JP Morgan trades says Ventana Were Enron to fail  Ventana thinks it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis worse  in some ways than what occurred after LTCM  That merely  froze the debt markets temporarily whereas Enron deals in the building-blocks  of the American economy Imagine gridlock in the markets for gas timber coal  metals fertiliser bandwidth or indeed any of the products Enron deals  in As yet this all seems  unlikely Many big traders were happy to deal with Enron this week although at  shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past Trading on  EnronOnline was reportedly strong Jim Donnell of Duke Energy a big energy trader  described a huge dichotomy between the collapse in confidence in Enron in the  equity and credit markets and the business as usual attitude taken by big  commodity trading firms when considering Enron as a counterparty Yet as questions about  Enrons credit-standing spread this week it began to have difficulty making  markets in some instruments Few firms would accept Enrons name as guarantor of  a credit derivative In its core energy markets some big trading counterparties  refused the Enron name On the InterContinental Exchange ICE two houses reportedly specified that they would not take  Enrons credit The biggest credit  exposure appeared to be with banks whose 3 billion of back-up lines to Enron  were drawn down last week JP Morgan arranged an additional 1 billion  emergency credit-line this week This back-up it is widely assumed is needed  mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade Too big to fail Is Enron too big and too  important to be allowed to fail Philip Verleger an energy economist thinks  that Enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced  Enrons rivals mostly disagree unsurprisingly But even Enrons worst  enemies do not yet expect the firm to die from its current crisis Most  traders seem keen that it should live Nobody likes to see a wholesale trader  disappear says one They admire Enrons armies of traders and their ability to  do deals EnronOnline is one of the Internets few success stories assuming its  huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits as the firm  claims Enrons and the  financial systems problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to  meet its obligations On the surface it is rich in assets if not cash But its  lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt In June 2000 The  Economist challenged Mr Lay to reply to accusations of arrogance  high-handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law His response was  revealing To show that such charges were baseless he pointed to another firm  unfairly maligned by critics Drexel Burnham Lambert an investment bank that  rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk-bond boom of the 1980s  Drexel was accused of arrogance he groused but it was only being very  innovative and very aggressive Drexel was not bailed out Michael Milken its  star ended up in jail and Drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and  ignominy

into the army ----------European Democracy You have two cows The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply If there arent any they invent some They pay you not to milk the cows They take both cows shoot one milk the other and pour the milk down the drain They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows ----------American Democracy The government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it After the election the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures The press dubs the affair cowgate but supports the president The cows sue you for breach of contract Your legal bills exceed your annual income You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy ----------Capitalism You have two cows You sell one and buy a bull Your herd

of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company The annual

should be Enron Capital  Trade Resources International Corp  FYI Cargill International SA is located and incorporated in Geneva Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations  Please also let me know if there is anything that needs to be done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to get this ISDA started on Enrons part Thanks and Regards Mara Alexander Sr Documentation Analyst Cargill Incorporated Tel 9529843417 Fax 9529843872 e-mail MaraAlexanderCargillcom This e-mail

thus still managing the product in the UK but generating no UK earnings Inland Revenue may call foul though Having said this we have successfully re-booked in the past when trades were done on the phone apparently without tax consequence  No one has taken a hard stand on the above - that I know of anyway  I would recommend just telling the book admin to rebook to ENA and see if we get any resistance  Clearly from a credit perspective we would much prefer to book both legs at ENA Hope all else is going well Rod -----Original Message-----From 	Shackleton Sara Sent	15 August 2001 2216 To	Nelson Roderick Subject	Assignment of crudeBrent spread trades from ECTRIC to ENA Hey Rod the Dude Mr Jason Williams of the Houston office has directed me to you I spoke with Harvard has an ENA ISDA Master Agreement the Master in place who is trading on EOL and all ENA trades are confirmed under the existing Master  Harvard executed a crudeBrent spread trade on EOL and discovered that the counterparty was ECTRIC and not ENA  Boy were they surprised Harvards request is whether ECTRIC can assign the trade to ENA  Then all of Harvards trades would be subject to the ENA Master and could be netted Is this a commercial issue  Does ENA need a Brent book to receive this trade An assignment from ECTRIC to ENA would be only an accommodation to Harvard  Please let me know what you think  Thanks SS PS  I never made it to London in June  My boyfriends mother was in the hospital then and she died two weeks later  My mother died a few weeks ago  Its been a bad summer  But Im taking a vacation from August 23 -

Investments Inc account with Goldman Sachs International Daniel Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement the Agreement with my colleague Angela Davis I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter relating to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed but were not in a position to resolve at the time  These are 1  Par 8 Arbitration which should conform to Clause J Par 14 of the Agreement  I recall that we were discussing the possible use of arbitration in the Agreement and existence of arbitration in the OSLA so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the Terms of Business Letter  Since we ultimately agreed to English courts I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will prevail if in conflict with the Agreement 2  Par 8 Arbitration which should be limited in the same manner as Clause J Par 11 as to limitation of liability  I believe that you and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement  Why shouldnt these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the account documentation  Regards Sara Shackleton Enron

Kathryn The customers appearing on Kims list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA  We will focus on the ISDA customers first  We will use the template developed by Brent for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties  Brent has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19  Using that  template our goal is to produce six 6 new amendments each week  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks first drafts  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement  Those six 6 customers include Sempra Energy Trading Corp old master Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc old master Dynegy Marketing and Trade old master Ameren Energy none American Electric Service Power Corporation none PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc under negotiation with ECC The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us Please let me know if you have further questions  Thanks  Sara Sara

Brent and he is working on the Entergy-Koch amendment for CommodityLogic  He cannot commit to a completion date at this time since he has some other priorities  Ive asked for Friday and he has indicated that may be aggressive  The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today ESA Password application Subscription Agreement  In light of this can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch   The Sales process is moving along and we will need to have these amendments ready to present to the customer soon  Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 108 Per our conversation today if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems eg ConfirmLogic that can be shared earlier with the clients  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added  We still need to be thinking of how to keep this process simple to allow quick turnaround yet satisfy the legal requirements for confirmations  I ask that you and Leslie continue to help define a better process for us and I will continue to work with Kim and the sales team to implement this process Thanks for your help

Roderick Subject	RE Trades as ENA Russell My view would be to follow the novation route ie 1	CP trades via EOL with ECTRIC 2	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master 3	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC This does mean that the CP must initially accept the European EOL GTCs though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs Justin -----Original Message-----From 	Dyk Russell Sent	27 September 2001 2338 To	Shackleton Sara Boyd Justin White Bill Shankman Jeffrey A Cc	Abramo Caroline Zivic Robyn Diamond Daniel Radous Paul Lebrocq Wendi Sharma Shifali Subject	FW Trades as ENA Everyone -Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs We just did two WTIBrent crude oil spreads today one w very large volume and expect to be doing more such deals This is more than just a legal issue its going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well As we understand it the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w ENA and not w ECTRIC so they and I assume we want all deals and legal exposure to be w ENA To satisfy both parties desires all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA Sara from speaking to you and from Justins response below it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we the funds and our traders might face is if no trader w ENA in Houston okays w the counterparty on ENAs behalf However there seem to be 2 other solutions a netting agreement and novating that get around this As Sara knows dealing on legal agreements w the funds can be onerous and time-consuming negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option From the credit side as we understand it the issue w not back-to-backing the trades w ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds net position in Houston and therefore not monitored In other words any exposure not sitting w ENA will be invisible to credit so daily margining etc will  be incorrect From the EnronOnline side as we see it there are a couple of issues EOL wants the funds to trade online an increasing number of funds also want to trade online However they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based Also they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTIBrent crude oil spread online If neither desire can be easily met bc we need a separate ISDA w ECTRIC which potentially means as above more onerous and time-consuming negotiation then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL We can assure you that they will not accept this These are the issues as we see them from the origination side There may be other issues that were missing from the sides that Ive mentioned as well as the tradingback office side Regards Russ -----Original Message-----From 	White Bill Sent	Thursday September 27 2001 332 PM To	Dyk

justin -----Original Message-----From 	Juggins Janine Sent	25 July 2001 1929 To	Beyhum Maya Boyd Justin Cc	Sharma Shifali Klar Guenther Sexton Camille Watt Julie Subject	RE Trades as ENA I assume that these are financial transactions The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - ie trade between ECTRIC and ENA trade between ENA and third party eg Bank of America It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC To avoid booking the back to back trades a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC arranged by EEFT instead of ECTRIC effective 1 November Regards Janine -----Original Message-----From 	Beyhum Maya Sent	25 July 2001 1413 To	Juggins Janine Boyd Justin Cc	Sharma Shifali Subject	Trades as ENA Hi I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA eg Bank of America As a result if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader who trades under ENA and Bank Of America The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office We were wondering about a couple of things Are there any taxlegal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration Thanks for your help Maya

Economist Article So far the worst article Ive seen yet Taken from this weeks edition A financial black hole Houston we have a problem Nov 1st 2001  HOUSTON LONDON AND NEW YORK From The Economist print  edition The troubles of Enron a Texan  powerhouse in the energy markets could result in a new financial  crisis JUST last year visitors  to Enrons glittering headquarters in Houston were greeted by a giant banner  that proclaimed the firm The worlds leading energy company That annoyed  Enrons smaller energy-trading rivals many of which have offices only a stones  throw away in Houstons Energy Alley but not as much as what came next-a new  banner declaring Enron The worlds leading company In recent weeks as the  company has been engulfed by a financial crisis that banner has quietly been  removed The heady mix of  audacity ambition and arrogance revealed by the banners is as good a guide as  any to Enrons remarkable rise and fall Forged in the 1980s by the merger of  two troubled gas-pipeline firms Enron drove the development of the  sophisticated spot-and-derivatives markets in energy that it has come to  dominate Indeed such is the scale of its operations and its dealings with  many of the worlds financial institutions that some observers see parallels  with Long-Term Capital Management LTCM the hedge fund  that failed in 1998-and not just because seemingly brilliant financial  alchemists have been humbled Were Enron to go bust-unlikely but in the current  nervous climate not impossible-might a crisis ensue Troubles in Californias  politically crazed power market an ill-advised foray into telecoms bandwidth  trading and concerns about management badly dented Enrons share price earlier  this year prompting the departure of Jeffrey Skilling the firms newish chief  executive in August Kenneth Lay an avid free-marketeer friend of George Bush  and visionary chairman of the firm was obliged to resume hands-on control This has not slowed  Enrons decline Day by day it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial  quagmire that is largely of its own creation Not least thanks to its lack of  transparency the firms credibility with the markets has eroded to the point  that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread Enrons reputation for  financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its  third-quarter results came out in mid-October showing a 1 billion write-off on  water distribution broadband trading and other investments Worse disclosed  only in passing by Mr Lay in a conference call with analysts the firm suffered  a 12 billion reduction in capital stemming from a hedging deal with a related  private-equity fund called LJM The charge was due to  Enrons forced sale of 55m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound  this summer Almost nobody outside Enron had been aware of the terms of the deal  with LJM a structured finance vehicle Enrons failure to offer  details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear  the worst about its huge balance sheet Its shares plunged by 19 on October  30th alone see chart before recovering a bit the next day Andrew Fastow who was  replaced as chief financial officer on October 24th was a general partner in  LJM  Jeffrey McMahon his successor has much to do to  restore confidence Questions abound Were the trusts run at arms length What  did Mr Fastow earn from the partnership Ominously the Securities and Exchange  Commission SEC has now launched a formal  inquiry Moodys a rating  agency last week cut its rating on the companys debt to barely above junk  level Further downgrades might unleash claims from other off-balance-sheet  partnerships Those known about such as Atlantic Water and Marlin Water do not  seem big enough to bankrupt Enron but speculation is rife about what other  obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles A lower credit rating  could destroy Enrons core franchise as the leading energy middleman by scaring  away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets That might have nasty  consequences in other markets Enron acknowledges that it is a large participant  in the derivatives market holding a portfolio with a notional value of 21  billion Rightly or wrongly many traders believe that figure vastly understates  Enrons presence If the firms on the other side of Enrons trades start to fear  that payment is not coming they might curb their other trading producing a  knock-on effect Where this could end up is a subject of much  conjecture Utilities that trade  energy could be hit So could the commodity and derivative operations of large  commercial and investment banks The ties are notably tight between Enron and  JP Morgan Chase according to Ventana Capital a research firm Not only does  JP Morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for Enron it also  has the largest derivative operation of any bank as well as a large business  trading commodities There is no doubt that Enron is on the other side of many  JP Morgan trades says Ventana Were Enron to fail  Ventana thinks it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis worse  in some ways than what occurred after LTCM  That merely  froze the debt markets temporarily whereas Enron deals in the building-blocks  of the American economy Imagine gridlock in the markets for gas timber coal  metals fertiliser bandwidth or indeed any of the products Enron deals  in As yet this all seems  unlikely Many big traders were happy to deal with Enron this week although at  shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past Trading on  EnronOnline was reportedly strong Jim Donnell of Duke Energy a big energy trader  described a huge dichotomy between the collapse in confidence in Enron in the  equity and credit markets and the business as usual attitude taken by big  commodity trading firms when considering Enron as a counterparty Yet as questions about  Enrons credit-standing spread this week it began to have difficulty making  markets in some instruments Few firms would accept Enrons name as guarantor of  a credit derivative In its core energy markets some big trading counterparties  refused the Enron name On the InterContinental Exchange ICE two houses reportedly specified that they would not take  Enrons credit The biggest credit  exposure appeared to be with banks whose 3 billion of back-up lines to Enron  were drawn down last week JP Morgan arranged an additional 1 billion  emergency credit-line this week This back-up it is widely assumed is needed  mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade Too big to fail Is Enron too big and too  important to be allowed to fail Philip Verleger an energy economist thinks  that Enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced  Enrons rivals mostly disagree unsurprisingly But even Enrons worst  enemies do not yet expect the firm to die from its current crisis Most  traders seem keen that it should live Nobody likes to see a wholesale trader  disappear says one They admire Enrons armies of traders and their ability to  do deals EnronOnline is one of the Internets few success stories assuming its  huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits as the firm  claims Enrons and the  financial systems problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to  meet its obligations On the surface it is rich in assets if not cash But its  lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt In June 2000 The  Economist challenged Mr Lay to reply to accusations of arrogance  high-handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law His response was  revealing To show that such charges were baseless he pointed to another firm  unfairly maligned by critics Drexel Burnham Lambert an investment bank that  rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk-bond boom of the 1980s  Drexel was accused of arrogance he groused but it was only being very  innovative and very aggressive Drexel was not bailed out Michael Milken its  star ended up in jail and Drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and  ignominy
