So you are telling me that her grade has dropped from 91 to 65?  Is this due that paper not being turned in?

Good Morning Mrs. Kobernick -

Just checking with you to see how Candis' day was today.  What is her
grade in your class as of today and did she ever turn that paper in that
she missed that day?  Thanks for keeping me informed.

Don't think of it as "dropped."  This is a new six weeks.  Remember, I don't have a lot of grades at this point, so any zeros really bring down their grades.  Once she turns in her work, it will com up.  You will be getting a detailed report on Friday.

I tried to add you to my MSN Instant Messenger service but Enron's email firewall has heightened it's security disabling me to log into outside email accounts.  Later after everything cools off and they ease up on the security we can use the instant messenger service. 

That church was a little slow compared to what I'm used too.  It might be due to the fact that they are an interracial congregation.  What is your friends name again that goes there?

Hey, Dana - 

No rush at all.  You can send it interoffice if you like. (EB 3339E)
Early next week would even be okay - I just wanted to make sure we had gotten it this month (since it apparently got lost en route to us last month).

Thanks!

Dana,
Please make a copy of the Hanson deposit for Pat.

Pat, 
We are just depositing it today.  Sorry, I got the check during my budget blitz and forgot to tell you.    

Thanks,

Hey, Tammy - 

Have you seen a check from Hanson this month?  If so, can I get a copy?  And if not, I'll give 'em a call.

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:
The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.  As the election date nears, Harris county voters' guides will be available at the InfoZone in the lobby.

Harris		713-368-2309
Montgomery	936-539-7843

Hi Dana,
Please let me know if you see any Linder money come in the next few days.
I'm wondering if they are going to make a Distribution this month.

Thanks.

Subject:	Global Accounting Compensation Survey

Several months ago a compensation survey was commissioned by Rick Causey to see how Enron's accounting compensation compared to our peers, with our main objective being to retain and attract the best possible talent.   The survey was comprehensive, including Fortune 100 companies and two big-5 accounting firms.  The results of the survey have highlighted that some of our salaries are below today's market. So ... we set out to fix that. 
We spent a significant amount of time looking at individual salaries benchmarked against the survey results of positions with similar responsibilities and experience levels.  Existing internal equity issues were also considered.
Early next week, we will contact everyone to discuss where your current salary falls in our new ranges. If your salary is going to be adjusted, we will communicate your new salary at that meeting. We will also give you your new Enron Wholesale Services - Financial Operations shirt ( yes.. we have changed our name back to Financial Operations). All salary adjustments will be effective September 1st. 
I know that this has been a busy and challenging year for everyone and is likely to remain that way for awhile. We have made tremendous progress toward our major goals this year of cleaning up our accounts, understanding our balance sheet, getting our arms around our cash flow, dealing with tremendous volume growth in trading and building timely and value-added management reporting products. I recognize and appreciate all of your efforts.

I need to ask a quick question.  I was trying to get Pam to get Hope to confirm Nov. 5th as my start date so that there wouldn't be any surprises.  Pam said that Hope gave her the OK to call Bill to discuss my transition date but he wasn't there so she had to leave him a message.  I'm not sure if that was yesterday or day before but they are speaking a little more openly about me leaving now and she mentioned that he hadn't returned her call.  I think they know that 3 weeks is a bit much so I think the call that she made to Bill is more less to make sure that he doesn't need me any earlier.  What do you think?  Give me a call please to let me know if there is anything else that I need to be doing at this time.

Thanks,
Dana

Oh God Carolyn, 
Your words have brought tears to my eyes and an ache in my heart.  I love you and miss you too but what encourages me is that I know God has us all in the palm of His hand. Your words have blessed and encouraged me to continue to seek Gods face in everything that I do. You know that it has been said then and I know that you have been hearing it now, time is too short, if not at hand for the coming of the Lord.  I'm just trying to get my house in order.  I love you like my sister and don't forget that.

You haven't called me about helping you with the house.  I told you that I would help you when you got ready.  Call me.

Love your sister,

Dana

Dana,

Just wanted to say that I really miss you.  It saddens me that you are not
sitting next to me anymore.  Although I know that we are still friends, you
have been so much more.  I have grown spiritually because of your teaching.

I'm not sure what to say, except:

Subject:	Full Requirements - Due Dilligence Items

I've been asked to pull together a "road-map" of the list of due dilligence items that need to be vetted on full requirements deals for Origination's off-site meeting next week.  I have drafted an initial list, attached below, but would appreciate any feedback you can offer on additional items or detail.  Thanks

- Jim

Subject:	NYISO Training

Either today or Monday, I expect the NYISO to announce that it will be offering its 3-day Market Orientation Course in Houston December 11-13 at the Hyatt Regency. Enrollment will be limited to 150 people on an as-registered basis, so early registration is encouraged. The on-line registration process will be included in their announcement, which will be broadcast to the ISO's TIE list as well as put on their web site www.NYISO.com. Because Enron has previously sent people through this training course, the costs for Enron employees attending this training session will be $800.00 per person, rather than the normal $1,200.00 charge. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

I've been asked to pull together a "road-map" of the list of due dilligence items that need to be vetted on full requirements deals for Origination's off-site meeting next week.  I have drafted an initial list, attached below, but would appreciate any feedback you can offer on additional items or detail.  Thanks
