This category measures a persons inherent skill talent intelligence and commitments to Enrons va lues  This determinant should not change drastically between each review p eriod since it measures whats inside a person and that should only change s lowly or with the development of new skills or the hiring of new and better qualified employees  In this category a person could be told whether they are excellent or superior or average and know that they have an opportunit y to improve on that ranking through their own effort while also realizing  that we are continually trying to raise the bar with new hires  This parti cular performance measurement is also a measure of the success of our hirin g and training program 092  Employee Performance - This a measure of how well an employee is per forming the tasks of any particular job  This measure could fluctuate much more than the first since each persons performance can vary greatly over  time based on many different circumstances  This measure would also distin guish those employees who may not be considered to have the best skills or  greatest intelligence but who through sheer hard work and determination are outstanding performers  It should also help identify those who are under  performing and not living up to their potential as measured by the first ca tegory  This category also measures our skill as managers and leaders of p eople since it is often the managers job to motivate people to perform abov e and beyond their own capability 093  Results - This is a measure of the financial performance and result  of the effort of any individual employee  I believe this criteria is most  suited to the commercial employees and should be the major determining fact or but not the only on in annual bonus payments  This should be closely  correlated to the Job Performance criteria but it may not always be since s ome people may be working on a long term project which has a payback at som e future date or in the other extreme someone could have lucked out by bein g in the right place at the right time and gaining the benefit from it with out the appropriate effort 09In addition to these three categories I would also reduce the Job Descri ptions that are included in the PRC process  I think it is a waste of time to include clerks  assistants accounting personnel and other non manager commercial support people in the process  Very little is gained by them o r by management and a tremendous amount of stress and ill will is created  I would also reduce the amount of time spent on the PRC at mid year and on ly focus on the first two performance categories at that time  I would als o change the time when the PRC review is done since now it happens in the s ummer when many people are trying to scheduled vacations and at year end wh en there is so much other business activity going on  I think a March Sep tember schedule would work much better 09There are probably many other ideas to improve the PRC process and I am  sure that you are working on them  Please give my ideas some thought and s ee if they dont merit some consideration
