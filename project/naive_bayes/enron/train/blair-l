Are you wanting to discount overrun equal to up to 5 of the contract MDQ on a daily basis or on a monthly basis  For example on 108489 MDQ73500 so 53675  Is it your intention to discount only up to 3675 overrun each day or would you discount up to 367530110250 Overrun for the month regardless of daily flow levels -----Original Message-----From 	Mercaldo Vernon Sent	Thursday December 06 2001 1155 AM To	Dornan Dari Bianchi Rita Blair Lynn Kirk Steve Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Subject	RE OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues Rita Not to complicate things but they have authorized overrun on thier contract for up to 5 of the MDQ at the contract rate demand  commodity  So there is a rate in the system for overrun as a tiered rate in the authorized overrun classification -----Original Message-----From 	Dornan Dari Sent	Thursday December 06 2001 1150 AM To	Bianchi Rita Mercaldo Vernon Blair Lynn Kirk Steve Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Subject	RE OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues I wouldnt want to do a discount because of full rate equivalent issues I like the exception better with a note in a file or something to explain it  But I defer to Steve on this -----Original Message-----From 	Bianchi Rita Sent	Thursday December 06 2001 1147 AM To	Mercaldo Vernon Blair Lynn Kirk Steve Dornan Dari Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Subject	RE OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues Importance	High Here are my 2 suggestions for the ONEOK dilemma 1 just discount Overrun down to max firm for the days when ONEOK nominated incorrectly and put an explanation of the circumstances in the Comment box 2 I could create a Tariff Exception on the ONEOK contract for the days in question setting the Overrun rate equal to the firm rate  Then it would not look like a discount  However there is no way to attach a comment to an exception Considerations The Transactional report will not pick up a post-dated discount but this isnt really a discount The discount but not the exception would show up on the 592 report - but nobody reads that anyway When they nominated as max rate overrun it got scheduled  Since they had a right to firm service they would have been scheduled if they had nominated correctly so they didnt really get an unfair advantage over other TI Steve  Dari - what do you think -----Original Message-----From 	Mercaldo Vernon Sent	Thursday December 06 2001 941 AM To	Blair Lynn Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Bianchi Rita Subject	OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues Lynn Earlier this month I noticed that OneOk Field Services incorrectly nominated 100 of their firm commodity as overrun  I pointed this out to Joe Linhart and he got OneOk to correct it for the balance of the month  Joe informed me that for the activity that had already been scheduled as overrun prior to that date couldnt be changed without a lot of work and it would be easier for me just to put in an overrun discount to get the invoice to come out correctly  Since rates are directly linked to our publicly available FERC mandated reporting I did not think that doctoring our rates would be the best solution either Do you have an idea on another way to correct this or of the two options we have which do you think is the best way to correct this before the commodity invoices go out on the 10th Thanks Vernon

mailtoCharlieGrahamENRONcom Sent Tuesday June 19 2001 242 PM To Delaine Kurth E-mail Subject Mt Jesus Condensate Delaine The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN now Oneok entitles Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the Northern pipelines equipment or facilities upstream of Oneoks Bushton Plant  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for picking-up hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids removed  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage attributable to such condensate and drip  Northern invoices Oneok monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtus attributable to the condensate removed Effective April 2000 Oneok began short paying its invoices  The table below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as 67 88936 This short payment reflects Oneoks refusal to reimburse Northern for removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip lease  71176  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneoks contract hauler contends the liquid removed from Northerns system at this point is water  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary Oneok accepts its contractors contention apparently pays a disposal fee and refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtus lost This location produced condensate prior to the March 31 1997 agreement and no change to Northerns pipeline operations that would impact condensation dropout has occurred  Oneok was properly reimbursing Northern prior to April 2000  In addition the attached analysis of liquid removed from the location on September 20 2000 demonstrates that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip Northern must insist that compensation for these BTUs removed from Northerns System be made by Oneok

for the time being would you work with George Marshall to send myself and Jodie Floyd an email if he identifies a potential EFM problem on the NNG north or south end    We will log the ticket as a Hot Seat entry   He will need to give us a little description - meter number and the techs name and location for the log entry purposes  You can see that Mike wants to document and track all EFM issues and would like himself and his Directors to be aware of the problems that could affect the customers measurement and affect UAF  PPAs   As we originally discussed  this can only be done if all EFM problems are funneled through the Measurement Desk By following such a process we can log and track the ticket to resolution when the volumes are correct in GMS  George does all the database work and most of the notification of measurement problems   We dont want to duplicate efforts while George is still here but we need to get the issues tracked in the log that will be sent to NNG  Market Services Management  Measurement Specialist  Measurement Operations NNG Marketing  Gas Control IT    NNG Field Operations George does a great job and we are doing our best to not disrupt his daily routine by duplicating efforts but we need him to keep us in the loop on potential measurement issues on any NNG station north or south    If we need to follow up on the status of volumetric issues we will contact the Tech   It would be good if George would give us updates on physicalsoftware repairs   Angela has set him up to get into the NNG Measurement Log and he could make his own NNG entries  updates early in the morning before Jodie arrives at 7 AM   That is up to him  He can actually get in the log anytime he wants by letting Jodie know he wants to make entries   I was told that George would be retiring the end of the year  Once George retires then we will start doing the notifications on the NNG EFM custody transfer collection issues  But in the mean time we need some help to make this NNG EFM effort work Tks -

	Scott Donna Sent	Friday August 31 2001 933 AM To	Blair Lynn January Steven Nacey Sheila Dietz Rick Holmes Bradley Corman Shelley Subject	NGI Publication concerning TW Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourse-rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates Mary Kay Miller vice president of rates and certificates acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes prior to posting its available capacity with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered moot by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted Even if they would have senta fax the day before capacity became available it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted at that time said Miller Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan 31 the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern were null and void The only relevant ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan 31 she noted Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwesterns methods for notifying customers about available capacity the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as 27MMBtu last February far in excess of the pipelines maximum allowed rate of 38 centsMMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total 45000 MMBtud of service on Transwestern during February and March Richardson and Sempra clearly did not have any deal entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony The two companies had the right to the capacity only after they submitted their bids after the posting period ended after Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted and after a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern Richardson or Sempra she noted Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E Sullivan to the contrary Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates Miller testified Sullivan an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets Tariffs and Rates OMTR Division of Litigation contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates see Daily GPI Aug 29 httpwwwintelligencepresscomsubscribersdailynewsd20010829ehtml In fact he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate so that shippers might be more willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when it became available But Miller counters that Sullivan offers not support for his claim She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson in response to a data request by Southern California Edison support Transwesterns claims Both companies replied no when asked whether any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate The capacity at issue was offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwesterns web site at the recourse rate there was no prohibition restrictions limitation condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate and any potential shipper including Richardson or Sempra could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate Sullivan contends that Transwesterns motive for allegedly advancing negotiated-rate transactions at the expense of recourse-rate deals was pure profit Under questioning by Thomas J Burgess of FERCs OMTR Miller conceded that Transwestern earned 18 million from Sempra Energys contract in March 13 million from Richardsons March contract and a comparable amount from Richardsons February contract She noted the pipeline received a substantially higher amount as a result of Sempras February contract but she didnt provide an exact figure FERCs Sullivan estimated the pipelines profit from the Sempra February contract was more than 5 million Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwesterns coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates But Miller countered that the Commissions negotiated-rate policy does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits Furthermore she said the Transwestern case shouldnt be used to consider changes to the negotiated-rate policy as Sullivan has suggested This case is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated-rate policy should only be done on an industry-wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged

Bodnar Michael Trevino Linda Subject	SBA Priority during Allocations Sue During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations some of the following issues came up  Gerry correct me if I misunderstood anything If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible my opinion is no they should only have this priority during the timely cycle If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible  my opinion is no they should only have this priority at Primary Points Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get squeezed out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate  Might have some mad shippers How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation Interruptible Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a point they dont follow the downstream will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as SBA IT This is for the future contracts system  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria

	Fossum Drew Sent	Wednesday September 19 2001 1024 AM To	Horton Stanley Neubauer Dave Cc	Lowry Phil Nelson Mike Craig Rick Miller Mary Kay Dietz Rick Blair Lynn Davis Britt Porter Gregory J Dornan Dari Darveaux Mary Subject	FW OneOk Talking Points Stan the Bushton Team met yesterday and decided that there is no value and substantial risk to Northern in accepting OneOks suggestion that we rewrite the Bushton Measurement Agreement to operate like the OneOk-Kinder Morgan Scott City measurement agreement  We are reluctant to incorporate the PTR formula in any way beyond the limited purpose it serves under the current Measurement Agreement  The following are talking points that Dave Neubauer will use today in a conversation with Terry Spencer who is Steve Winstons boss  Since Winstons proposal which I sent to you by email last week was a draft and has never been formally sent to us we decided that having Dave deliver our message to Terry made more sense than sending a letter or elevating the issue to your and John Gibsons level  However if Gibson calls you and raises the issue of their proposal the following points contain our message Spencer may agree in the call with Dave to reconcile the April and May imbalance based on our metered numbers  If not Britt has prepared a demand letter that can be sent at any time to get resolution of that issue rolling  I believe that Gibson indicated that hed be calling you back this week to talk about this matter so your conversation should take place before we send the demand letter Ill forward the demand letter for your review separately On the other proposal from OneOk that I forwarded to you last week relating to operational changes designed to allow OneOk to get the helium plant running again we have made some minor modifications and are sending the counterproposal back to OneOk  We expect to get that deal in place with them soon  This is a good development for them and with little or no risk to us and should temper any disappointment they feel because of our rejection of their measurment proposal Please give me a call if you have any questions or concerns  Thanks DF 1  Steve Winstons suggested approach is similar to ONEOKs Scott City measurement agreement with Kinder Morgan  It uses PTR as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds  That structure is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agreement which as reaffirmed by the arbitrators does not make the numbers from Northerns ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOKs PTR numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a BTU measurement error ie when the chromatograph malfunctions 2  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEOKs PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the Oneok meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AGA quality specifications  ONEOKs independent outside experts Barnes and Click confirmed this fact during the arbitration 3  ONEOK can currently use PTR or any other means it wants to determine whether to call a special test of the accuracy of Northerns ultrasonic meters pursuant to Section 2e of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement  Upon calling a special test any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters  ONEOK has not called for a special test but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning 4  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to track the structure of the Scott City procedure ONEOK must bring its measurement and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specifications 5  The current imbalance at the Plant is about 12 million owed to ONEOK based on Northerns meters  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plant which dates to April and May of this year must be resolved irrespective of what ONEOK desires to do going forward  Since ONEOK has not called a special test of Northerns meters the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months  If ONEOK does not agree to that reconciliation Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies

10 of the point s HFQ   If such approach fails to meet the needs of an interconnected part y Northern Borders tariff does permit the use of an alternative tolerance level at a given point of interconnect as long as it has been mutually agr eed to both OBA parties 20 Furthermore the daily OBA swings at interconnects on Northern Border that  are on pressure control will also be monitored more closely the default da ily OBA imbalance tolerance level will be -

the past couple of days I need to pass along the following observations I only included on the address list the ones that I could think of off the top of my head who regularly attend the meeting so please dont think Ive limited the list and please pass this on to the others who attend The microphones in Houston are extremely sensitive to any noise Paper shuffling is the biggest problem Even straightening papers or turning a page has the effect of blocking out the speakers voice Gas Dailies should be left at your desk Whispering can also be heard It tends to make it very difficult to hear in Omaha It is also imperative that the microphone be put very near the person who speaking particularly if their voice doesnt carry I dont quite understand when it can pick up whispers but cant pick up a softer speakers voice but thats the way it is I think if we are all aware of that we can greatly enhance the quality of the meeting for the Omaha participants thanks sj

how OBAs are organized and how they are applied - the operation of hubs - the balancing penalties - the trading of capacity - the general operation of a big pipeline - the general operation of a state pipeline and of a LDC - the operation of a shipper Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your american colleagues on any of these items ---In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader in Atlanta on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper on many pipelines and storages and to another major shipper and producer in Houston on the relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities as well as on the access practice A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework To my opinion Northern would be all right It should act as a model to what could also be arranged with time by big transmission operators in our country It could refer to the dispatching operation and to the commercial scheduling of transmission to the nomination balancing and allocation as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities If possible two days would be a proper duration I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person so there would be no need of formal presentations The opportunity to see real operations and to discuss with experts would be all right In the past when I was in Snam I took the opportunity of keeping in touch with the developments in the Usa So I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system Last time was some years ago when I visited Transcanada in Calgary for a week focusing on nomination and balancing Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years there were EL Paso PGE Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me As for the period it would be in the second half of August because with september there would be a very heavy workload to do here in Milano Thank you and best regards Mauro Dear Alfredo Im finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte on TPA practice there Among of meetings Im going to arrange it would be of interest a visit at a major pipeline Northern seems to me a good example Would you envisage it as a possible example for me I would discuss the organization of dispatching see the nomination and balancing operation the allocation of measurement and other major aspects of TPA implementation including OBAs with interconnecting pipelines for transmission and storage Im considering the end of August for such a visit Owing to the extent of the subjects maybe two days would be appropriate Thank you and best regards Mauro

1 QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount  or volume lower than scheduled amount                 2 RANK changed to a different number     2  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in  relation to mandatory monthly cash out          Answer - Tariff Sheet 268 D  E     3  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc  allocation          Answer - Beatrice Trailblazer and demarc are the only  two points in the group     4  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is  allocated can Virginia Power          switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and  keep their gas flowing          Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery  IS included in a demarc allocation                 because the transport tied to this storage  nomination is physically coming from                        the field to the market area Greg we may  not have been clear on this comment                 on the conference call This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient s Any review use distribution or disclosure by others is strictly prohibited If you are not the intended recipient or authorized to receive for the recipient please contact the sender or reply to Enron Corp at enronmessagingadministrationenroncom and delete all copies of the message This e-mail and any attachments hereto are not intended to be an offer or an acceptance and do not create or evidence a binding and enforceable contract between Enron Corp or any of its affiliates and the intended recipient or any other party and may not be relied on by anyone as the basis of a contract by estoppel or otherwise Thank you

To	Sebesta Chris Blair Lynn Cc	Bill Zorr Kelly Schneider Semin Frank Subject	RE Zone Allocations It may be standard practice in your opinion but Kelly Bill and I have never heard of this or remember it happening to us  Also Entergy-Koch was completely surprised by it as well  We just cant understand why you would call a reduction in a withdrawal an injection  Your allocation is limiting storage injections and we were not making an injection  Wed like to know where to find this in the tariff so we can read it and understand it better  We pulled looked at the 8 am process instructions on the web and it doesnt say anything about this What is really upsetting to us is were thought we were set up fine to be in compliance with the SUL and suddenly we couldnt do what we thought we had a right to do even though Hot Tap accepted the nomination  On top of that no one from NNG called us to let us know that our nomination had been undone and the same thing would have happened to us on the 1115 gas day if we hadnt been lucky enough to have found it on our own  We pushed the gas across to ANR but we are going to incur penalties from them as a result  The other really strange thing is that during the intraday processes we can cut back on our withdrawal even though storage is allocated but you cant do it at 8 am  It just doesnt make any sense to us  Sebesta Chris ChrisSebestaenroncom 111601 1032AM  Jeff I am sorry WPL and IES are experiencing allocation problems  It is standard procedure during a storage injection allocation the 8 am true up process does not allow FDD withdrawal reductions or storage injections  Many other shippers are also working hard to manage their business  Other than getting truer information on your markets needs or finding alternate markets for your excess capacity I dont have any other ideas on how to address your zone allocations As requested I will add this item to our December 10 meeting agenda -----Original Message-----From Jeff Hicken mailtoJeffHickenalliant-energycom Sent Thursday November 15 2001 300 PM To Sebesta Chris Blair Lynn Cc Bill Zorr Kelly Schneider Subject Re Zone Allocations Chris You should know that we are unhappy about something else now  For the 1114 gas day you NNG did not let us reduce our FDD withdrawal nomination to zero in the 8 am process like normal because of a storage injection allocation  Because of this WPL is going to get hit with SUL DDVC penalties Entergy-Koch who handles the IES assests was surprised by this as well and IES may incur penalties too We werent trying to make an injection we were just trying to cut our withdrawal to zero  We always schedule a maximum withdrawal in the winter because we are always at risk of a zone allocaton just like we have been seeing lately  Weve had conference call with Jean Blair and Jerry Wilkens on the topic  We are also in trouble now for the 1115 gas day which we are current trying to figure a way out of  You can add this item to our

you to call Jeff Hicken of Alliant Energy  He would like someone to explain 1 why he is getting allocated at the zone level when he is trying to adjust his timely cycle noms later in the day to

Gerry Cc	Blair Lynn Subject	RE Questions on MDQ Importance	High GerryLynn Yes the volume nominated to the inletfrom the outlet is factored into a firm contracts MDQ total At a high-level  there should be no special MDQ-related coding at Bushton inletoutlet that causes an override per se of a contracts MDQ allowing shippers to double their contract MDQ I did a preliminary check using model office to confirm coding logic at the nomination levellooking at K6425 BP Energy that has a total contract MDQ of 20835 MMbtu   When nominating above the 20835 K MDQ you can only nominate to inletfrom outlet up to the contracts MDQ utilizing transaction type 01 current business  Any additional vols nominated above the contract MDQ must then be nominated as transaction type 02 overrun We do have shippers that nom in to  out of the plant on the same contract initial research indicated there are contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton ie same contract nominating to inlet is the same contract picking up the gas at the outlet    The IT Group  however could run a quick report to checkconfirm this Hope I answered your questions Legale -----Original Message-----From 	Medeles Gerry

Bushton factored into any MDQ total  Gerry if you are not the person to help us on this please let me know who  Also in talking with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of Bushton you DO double your MDQ  Therefore if you have 10000 MDQ you can only nominate 5000 to inlet and 5000 at outlet Gerry can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton   If she is right then we have NOT had anyone nominate on the same contract  If I have confused you lets discuss  Thanks Lynn -----Original Message-----From 	Paladino Ranelle Sent	Friday September 21 2001 449 PM To	Blair Lynn Pritchard John Winckowski Michele Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Darveaux Mary Subject	RE Questions on MDQ So when a shipper is required because of the producers processing rights to nominate from their primary receipt point to Bushton Inlet and then from the Bushton Outlet to Demarc is that treated as one nomination from a receipt to a delivery OR is that treated as two nominations on the same contract with one receipt at their primary receipt point and another receipt at the Bushton Outlet thus exceeding the contract MDQ sending the shipper into overrun assuming the shipper was nominating the entire MDQ throughout the path Didnt we also have a situation where shippers were going from a receipt point to Demarc and not going through Bushton when they were supposed to--or maybe it was that shippers were going from Bushton Outlet to Demarc and not getting charged fuel when they werent supposed to be able to do that transaction--I just remember something happening not too long ago Thanks for the help with these questions Ranelle -----Original Message-----From 	Blair Lynn Sent	Friday September 21 2001 441 PM To	Pritchard John Paladino Ranelle Winckowski Michele Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Blair Lynn Darveaux Mary Subject	Questions on MDQ Ranelle John and Michelle  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this helps simplify our answer to your question The question is  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths ie nom on same contract from 1 Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from 2 Bushton Outlet to Demac For Nominating purposes MDQ of contract  Primary Firm  Alternate Firm up to the MDQ Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point EXAMPLE If the Field MDQ is 10000 then we will  1 total the reciepts nominated on the contract 2 compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ  Then the shipper will get firm primary and alternate up to their contract MDQ  Anything over will be overrun at IT rate If anyone has any other questions please let me know  Thanks Lynn

Tariff Sheet 268 D  E     3  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc  allocation          Answer - Beatrice Trailblazer and demarc are the only  two points in the group     4  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is  allocated can Virginia Power          switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and  keep their gas flowing          Answer -

clarify a storage withdrawal reduction essentially created the same physical effect as would an injection during the recent storage allocations For example If the storage fields had a net injection on a given day of 100 dthphysical maximumand at the 800 am cycle an injection increased by 25 dth it would be denied because of the physical limitations The same limitation would occur if a withdraw was reduced by 25 dth creating a net 125 dth injection at the 800 am process because the same physical limitation existing Injections	150 Withdrawals	 50 Net 		100 physical limitation Trying to reduce a

can impact the interruptible storage availability during the intra-day cycles whereas the 800 am process is only a individual true-up and not interative with the other storage agreements Lynn and

your opinion but Kelly Bill and I have never heard of this or remember it happening to us  Also Entergy-Koch was completely surprised by it as well  We just cant understand why you would call a reduction in a withdrawal an injection  Your allocation is limiting storage injections and we were not making an injection  Wed like to know where to find this in the tariff so we can read it and understand it better  We pulled looked at the 8 am process instructions on the web and it doesnt say anything about this What is really upsetting to us is were thought we were set up fine to be in compliance with the SUL and suddenly we couldnt do what we thought we had a right to do even though Hot Tap accepted the nomination  On top of that no one from NNG called us to let us know that our nomination had been undone and the same thing would have happened to us on the 1115 gas day if we hadnt been lucky enough to have found it on our own  We pushed the gas across to ANR but we are going to incur penalties from them as a result  The other really strange thing is that during the intraday processes we can cut back on our withdrawal even though storage is allocated but you cant do it at 8 am  It just doesnt make any sense to us  Sebesta Chris ChrisSebestaenroncom 111601 1032AM  Jeff I am sorry WPL and IES are experiencing allocation problems  It is standard procedure during a storage injection allocation the 8 am true up process does not allow FDD withdrawal reductions or storage injections  Many other shippers are also working hard to manage their business  Other than getting

Tom Cc	Blair Lynn Dietz Rick Floyd Jodie Subject	RE Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings Even if they were it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined On these types of installations how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities  NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet todays business needs so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists and identify the costs to resolve the problem

Rick Floyd Jodie Zadow Raetta Subject	FW Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas Gary was wondering if you could help us out Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldnt read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume  The reason for this is because especially in the winter time this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe  If these charts cannot be read daily what can we do to make it so that they can Could you please check to find out what

Mauro Formaggio Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory Authority I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past re UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA He is now working on the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market and he is asking if he could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline despatching operation commercial scheduling of transmission nomination balancing and allocation as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities Please see this e-mail below He has not yet decided the dates but he is aiming at last week of August for 12 days I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation who could help on this and I would co-ordinate Formaggios meeting Alfredo Im scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA in the month of August The aspects Im considering are - how OBAs are organized and how they are applied - the operation of hubs - the balancing penalties - the trading of capacity - the general operation of a big pipeline - the general operation of a state pipeline and of a LDC - the operation of a shipper Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your american colleagues on any of these items ---In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader in Atlanta on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper on many pipelines and storages and to another major shipper and producer in Houston on the relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities as well as on the access practice A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework To my opinion Northern would be all right It should act as a model to what could also be arranged with time by big transmission operators in our country It could refer to the dispatching operation and to the commercial scheduling of transmission to the nomination balancing and allocation as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities If possible two days would be a proper duration I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person so there would be no need of formal presentations The opportunity to see real operations and to discuss with experts would be all right In the past when I was in Snam I took the opportunity of keeping in touch with the developments in the Usa So I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system Last time was some years ago when I visited Transcanada in Calgary for a week focusing on nomination and balancing Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years there were EL Paso PGE Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me As for the period it would be in the second half of August because with september there would be a very heavy workload to do here in Milano Thank you and best regards Mauro Dear Alfredo Im finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte on TPA practice there Among of meetings Im going to arrange it would be of interest a visit at a major pipeline Northern seems to me a good example Would you envisage it as a possible example for me I would discuss the organization of dispatching see the nomination and balancing operation the allocation of measurement and other major aspects of TPA implementation including OBAs with interconnecting pipelines for transmission and storage Im considering the end of August for such a visit Owing to the extent of the subjects maybe two days would be appropriate Thank you and best regards Mauro

you could introduce the topic by talking about the history and background and the situation it has put your pipelines in Our goal is get people to understand the root of the problem get them to understand how different pipelines are affected by the problem depending on far they are from the supply Then we could go around the room and ask people about their experiences with the problem and how they are dealing with it  What do you think Todd Hudson Information Systems Analyst Gas System Operations 4159731386 -----Original Message-----From LynnBlairenroncom mailtoLynnBlairenroncom Sent

PenkavaETSEnron Frank SeminETSEnron Subject	Terra Nitrogen Corporation LE11781 TransCanada Energy Marketing agent Terra is building an outstanding balance due NNG on the AR and an explanation is in order for the sequence of events  With the latest Commodity Close the AR will total 52844591 which includes a PPA in the amount of 17121780 February  This will be rolling on to the 30 days Customer report very shortly Earlier this spring discussions were held with Loren and Frank regarding Terras contract 104684 and Decembers transportation invoice  Scheduled quantities reports for December 2000 through February 2001 were sent for their review The decision was made to repath the December Reservation in order to revise the basevariable volumes which resulted in a PPA in the amount of 17550780  A PPA form was signed by all parties and forwarded accordingly  In early March we determined we had monies due Terra and after discussions with Loren it was agreed we would net all invoices currently on the AR -- this included the December PPA   Bill Fowler had talked to TransCanada and left a detailed voicemail for Audie Bremmer Terra  The net monies wired to Terra totaled 29515536 In late March Loren advised us to repath the February Reservation in order to revise the basevariable volumes which resulted in a PPA in the amount of 17121780  A PPA form was signed by all parties for this one as well  There was no reason to repath January 2001 In April Kathy tried to telephone Audie who would not return her call  His message to her through his assistant Maggie was that he would not pay any invoice without a telephone call from Frank  This was relayed to Loren and he relayed same to Frank  As a side note Frank had seen Audie at some industry function fairly recently and had tried to call Audie -- Audie had not returned his calls In last weeks followup with Loren he relayed that Frank had visited with Dave Neubauer on this issue and the feeling was that December was closed and we would waive February  However Bill Fowler feels February should still stand  Loren shared there was a similar deal with Minnegasco and they had to pay the revised invoice  If we allowed the February to be waived TransCanada would relay that info to Minnegasco I plan to talk to Loren again mid-week to update this issue to see if he and Frank feel the timing is acceptable for us to contact Audie  Should anyone have any questions or suggestions please advise -- will be in the office 630 am-330 pm this week Thanks S

firm contracts MDQ total At a high-level  there should be no special MDQ-related coding at Bushton inletoutlet that causes an override per se of a contracts MDQ allowing shippers to double their contract MDQ I did a preliminary check using model office to confirm coding logic at the nomination levellooking at K6425 BP Energy that has a total contract MDQ of 20835 MMbtu   When nominating above the 20835 K MDQ you can only nominate to inletfrom outlet up to the contracts MDQ utilizing transaction type 01 current business  Any additional vols nominated above the contract MDQ must then be nominated as transaction type 02 overrun We do have shippers that nom in to  out of the plant on the same contract initial research indicated there are contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton ie same contract nominating to inlet is the same contract picking up the gas at the outlet    The IT Group  however could run a quick report to checkconfirm this Hope I answered your

Questions on MDQ Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total  Gerry if you are not the person to help us on this please let me know who  Also in talking with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of Bushton you DO double your MDQ  Therefore if you have 10000 MDQ you can only nominate 5000 to inlet and 5000 at outlet Gerry can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton   If she is right then we have NOT had anyone nominate on the same contract  If I have confused you lets discuss  Thanks Lynn -----Original Message-----From 	Paladino Ranelle Sent	Friday September 21 2001 449 PM To	Blair Lynn Pritchard John Winckowski Michele Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Darveaux Mary Subject	RE Questions on MDQ So when a shipper is required because of the producers processing rights to nominate from their primary receipt point to Bushton Inlet and then from the Bushton Outlet to Demarc is that treated as one nomination from a receipt to a delivery OR is that treated as two nominations on the same contract with one receipt at their primary receipt point and another receipt at the Bushton Outlet thus exceeding the contract MDQ sending the shipper into overrun assuming the shipper was nominating the entire MDQ throughout the path Didnt we also have a situation where shippers were going from a receipt point to Demarc and not going through Bushton when they were supposed to--or maybe it was that shippers were going from Bushton Outlet to Demarc and not getting charged fuel when they werent supposed to be able to do that transaction--I just remember something happening not too long ago Thanks for the help with these questions Ranelle -----Original Message-----From 	Blair Lynn Sent	Friday September 21 2001 441 PM To	Pritchard John Paladino Ranelle Winckowski Michele Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Blair Lynn Darveaux Mary Subject	Questions on MDQ Ranelle John and Michelle  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this helps simplify our answer to your question The question is  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths ie nom on same contract from 1 Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from 2 Bushton Outlet to Demac For Nominating purposes MDQ of contract  Primary Firm  Alternate Firm up to the MDQ Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point EXAMPLE If the Field MDQ is 10000 then we will  1 total the reciepts nominated on the contract 2 compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ  Then the shipper will get firm primary and alternate up to their contract MDQ  Anything over will be overrun at IT rate If anyone has any other questions please let me know  Thanks Lynn

Are you wanting to discount overrun equal to up to 5 of the contract MDQ on a daily basis or on a monthly basis  For example on 108489 MDQ73500 so 53675  Is it your intention to discount only up to 3675 overrun each day or would you discount up to 367530110250 Overrun for the month regardless of daily flow levels -----Original Message-----From 	Mercaldo Vernon Sent	Thursday December 06 2001 1155 AM To	Dornan Dari Bianchi Rita Blair Lynn Kirk Steve Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Subject	RE OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues Rita Not to complicate things but they have authorized overrun on thier contract for up to 5 of the MDQ at the contract rate demand  commodity  So there is a rate in the system for overrun as a tiered rate in the authorized overrun classification -----Original Message-----From 	Dornan Dari Sent	Thursday December 06 2001 1150 AM To	Bianchi Rita Mercaldo Vernon Blair Lynn Kirk Steve Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Subject	RE OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues I wouldnt want to do a discount because of full rate equivalent issues I like the exception better with a note in a file or something to explain it  But I defer to Steve on this -----Original Message-----From 	Bianchi Rita Sent	Thursday December 06 2001 1147 AM To	Mercaldo Vernon Blair Lynn Kirk Steve Dornan Dari Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Subject	RE OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues Importance	High Here are my 2 suggestions for the ONEOK dilemma 1 just discount Overrun down to max firm for the days when ONEOK nominated incorrectly and put an explanation of the circumstances in the Comment box 2 I could create a Tariff Exception on the ONEOK contract for the days in question setting the Overrun rate equal to the firm rate  Then it would not look like a discount  However there is no way to attach a comment to an exception Considerations The Transactional report will not pick up a post-dated discount but this isnt really a discount The discount but not the exception would show up on the 592 report - but nobody reads that anyway When they nominated as max rate overrun it got scheduled  Since they had a right to firm service they would have been scheduled if they had nominated correctly so they didnt really get an unfair advantage over other TI Steve  Dari - what do you think -----Original Message-----From 	Mercaldo Vernon Sent	Thursday December 06 2001 941 AM To	Blair Lynn Cc	Kowalke Terry Buchanan John Berger Larry Janzen Randy Linhart Joe Williams Jo Joyce Jane Bianchi Rita Subject	OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues Lynn Earlier this month I noticed that OneOk Field Services incorrectly nominated 100 of their firm commodity as overrun  I pointed this out to Joe Linhart and he got OneOk to correct it for the balance of the month  Joe informed me that for the activity that had already been scheduled as overrun prior to that date couldnt be changed without a lot of work and it would be easier for me just to put in an overrun discount to get the invoice to come out correctly  Since rates are directly linked to our publicly available FERC mandated reporting I did not think that doctoring our rates would be the best solution either Do you have an idea on another way to correct this or of the two options we have which do you think is the best way to correct this before the commodity invoices go out on the 10th Thanks Vernon

mailtoCharlieGrahamENRONcom Sent Tuesday June 19 2001 242 PM To Delaine Kurth E-mail Subject Mt Jesus Condensate Delaine The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN now Oneok entitles Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the Northern pipelines equipment or facilities upstream of Oneoks Bushton Plant  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for picking-up hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids removed  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage attributable to such condensate and drip  Northern invoices Oneok monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtus attributable to the condensate removed Effective April 2000 Oneok began short paying its invoices  The table below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as 67 88936 This short payment reflects Oneoks refusal to reimburse Northern for removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip lease  71176  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneoks contract hauler contends the liquid removed from Northerns system at this point is water  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary Oneok accepts its contractors contention apparently pays a disposal fee and refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtus lost This location produced condensate prior to the March 31 1997 agreement and no change to Northerns pipeline operations that would impact condensation dropout has occurred  Oneok was properly reimbursing Northern prior to April 2000  In addition the attached analysis of liquid removed from the location on September 20 2000 demonstrates that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip Northern must insist that compensation for these BTUs removed from Northerns System be made by Oneok

for the time being would you work with George Marshall to send myself and Jodie Floyd an email if he identifies a potential EFM problem on the NNG north or south end    We will log the ticket as a Hot Seat entry   He will need to give us a little description - meter number and the techs name and location for the log entry purposes  You can see that Mike wants to document and track all EFM issues and would like himself and his Directors to be aware of the problems that could affect the customers measurement and affect UAF  PPAs   As we originally discussed  this can only be done if all EFM problems are funneled through the Measurement Desk By following such a process we can log and track the ticket to resolution when the volumes are correct in GMS  George does all the database work and most of the notification of measurement problems   We dont want to duplicate efforts while George is still here but we need to get the issues tracked in the log that will be sent to NNG  Market Services Management  Measurement Specialist  Measurement Operations NNG Marketing  Gas Control IT    NNG Field Operations George does a great job and we are doing our best to not disrupt his daily routine by duplicating efforts but we need him to keep us in the loop on potential measurement issues on any NNG station north or south    If we need to follow up on the status of volumetric issues we will contact the Tech   It would be good if George would give us updates on physicalsoftware repairs   Angela has set him up to get into the NNG Measurement Log and he could make his own NNG entries  updates early in the morning before Jodie arrives at 7 AM   That is up to him  He can actually get in the log anytime he wants by letting Jodie know he wants to make entries   I was told that George would be retiring the end of the year  Once George retires then we will start doing the notifications on the NNG EFM custody transfer collection issues  But in the mean time we need some help to make this NNG EFM effort work Tks -
