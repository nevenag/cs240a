about Calpine and others 0 coupon convertible bonds with put options - due April 02  This is ugly RH -------------------Fortune November 26 2001 SECTION FEATURESTOXIC BONDS Pg 131 LENGTH  2242 words HEADLINE Headed For A Fall Companies issued special  zero-coupon bonds assuming theyd never have to pay them off Now  shareholders could be on the hook for a  65 billion tab BYLINE Janice  Revell BODY It was an irresistible proposition Borrow  billions of dollars pay no interest reap millions in tax breaks and then  wait for the debt to simply disappear That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds and companies from Enron to Merrill Lynch  binged on what seemed like free money But of course there was a  catch For this scenario to play out a companys stock price had to rise  sharply--and quickly Thats because investors bought the bonds in the hope  of converting them into equity--if the stock tanked the bonds would no  longer be worth converting So to make them more attractive to buyers companies had to build in an escape hatch If the stock price failed to  rise sufficiently investors could put that is sell the bonds back to  the company--in many cases after just one year And thats exactly  whats about to happen--to the tune of some  65 billion over the next three  years Stock prices have fallen so far that for at least half of these  special hybrids the prospect of conversion is now absurd It simply wont  happen So bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance they can And because of the put feature that is possible Suddenly  companies like Tyco Comcast and dozens more are on the hook for billions  of dollars in debt and interest they thought theyd never have to pay That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies After all theyre the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when  all that debt comes due Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance  sheets to repay bondholders Companies without enough cash--and the majority  fall into this camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when  they borrow money anew That means sharply reduced earnings Especially at risk are investors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer refinancing costs Some companies may even be  forced to issue stock to pay off the debt creating significant shareholder  dilution especially at current depressed prices To make matters worse  this is happening at a time when the economy is barreling downhill and  corporate profits are already shrinking This is a ticking time bomb warns Margaret Patel manager of the Pioneer High Yield Bond fund a  top-performing junk fund The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000  when the stock market started to falter Companies in search of capital  balked at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were struggling Zero-coupon convertible bonds presented an attractive  alternative because companies didnt have to make cash interest payments on  the bonds hence the name zero Instead issuers offered an up-front  discount--for instance investors would buy a bond for  700 and collect   1000 when it matured Companies also gave investors the right to  convert the bonds into a fixed number of common shares But the bonds were structured so that conversion would make sense only if the stock price  rose significantly--in many cases by more than 50 With that protective  feature called the conversion premium zeros took off Corporate issuers  would pay no interest and once their stock prices had climbed back to  acceptable levels the debt would be swept away into equity If the bonds  are converted its a home run for everybody says Jonathan Cohen vice  president of convertible-bond analysis at Deutsche Bank That  four-bagger of course depends entirely on the stock price rising If it  doesnt the bondholders armed with that handy put feature can simply sell  the bonds back to the company Great for bondholders but not so hot for the  company or its shareholders But hey what are the odds of that happening CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go up  says Cohen They dont worry about the bond getting put If all this  seems a little complicated thats because it is A real-life example should  help California-based electric utility Calpine issued  1 billion in zeros  in April to refinance existing debt At the time the companys stock was  trading at about  55 a share--severely undervalued in the opinion of company management We really didnt want to sell equity at that  point says Bob Kelly Calpines senior vice president of finance So the  company instead opted to sell zeros setting the conversion premium at a  hefty 37 Still with no cash interest payments and a stock price that  had to rise significantly to make conversion worthwhile the bonds werent exactly a screaming buy for investors So Calpine added the put  feature Investors could sell the bonds back to the company after one year  at the full purchase price eliminating any downside risk Things  havent exactly worked out as management had hoped The stock has since  plummeted to  25 and it now has to triple before conversion makes sense  So its looking as though Calpine will be liable for the  1 billion in  borrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April  Theres also the refinancing cost According to Kelly Calpines borrowing rate could run in the neighborhood of 85--an extra  85  million per year in cash Obviously nobody plans for their stock to go  down Kelly says I dont think there was one person around who thought  the bond would be put Calpines potential costs are particularly high  because its credit rating is straddling junk If you are a borderline investment-grade company a financing of this nature is not necessarily  the most appropriate thing in the world notes Anand Iyer head of global  convertible research at Morgan Stanley The problem is there are a slew of  companies with far worse credit ratings out there Jeff Seidel Credit  Suisse First Bostons head of convertible-bond research estimates that  about half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category And others are at risk of having their ratings downgraded before the put  date Today with junk yielding as much as 5 12 percentage points above  bonds rated investment grade refinancing can be a pricey proposition Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by  the high price of junk It has  845 million in zeros that it will probably  have to buy back this January and another  42 billion coming down the  pike over the next couple of years Because of slower-than-expected sales  the company was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating  agencies And if Solectrons credit is downgraded the zeros would slide  into junk status a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of millions of dollars in refinancing charges Refinancing isnt the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros Companies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3 of the amount raised If the debt is sold back many  will have spent millions for what essentially amounted to a one-year loan  Theyre getting bad advice claims one banker who didnt want to be named  Look at the fee the banker earned and look at the kind of financing risk  the company got into As if those potential consequences were not scary  enough shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first issued Thats because some 40 are bought by hedge funds which short  the companys stock sell borrowed shares with the intention of buying them  back at a lower price at the same time that they buy the bonds If the  stock goes down the shorts make money from their position If it goes up  they profit by converting the bond to stock This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet at least for a while Grocery chain  Supervalu for example recently lost 10 of its market cap the day it  announced it was issuing  185 million in zeros Despite all the  pitfalls the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continues thanks in  large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they provide In fact  the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of financing  Even better thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code companies can rake in  huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than theyre actually  paying All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if  certain conditions prevail Verizon Communications for instance would pay  025 annual interest on its  3 billion in zero bonds if its stock price  falls below 60 of the issues conversion price In the eyes of the IRS  oddly that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction for tax purposes of 75--the same rate it pays on its  regular debt Why Trust us you dont want to know That adds up to an  annual deduction of more than  200 million even if Verizon never shells  out a dime in interest Not surprisingly more than half of the zeros issued  in 2001 contain similar clauses Its an incredible deal for them says  Vadim Iosilevich who runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management Not only are they raising cheap money theyre also doing  tax arbitrage So despite the enormous risks to shareholders companies continue to issue zeros at a steady clip According to ConvertBondcom  seven new issues totaling  35 billion have been sold since Oct 1 alone  I think the power of the tax advantage is going to keep them around says  CSFBs Seidel Call it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it doesnt really matter Either way its the shareholders wholl be left paying the bill
