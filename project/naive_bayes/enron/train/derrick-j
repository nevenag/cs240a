The Hindu An interesting article  Could it happen This article is emailed to you by tushar s dhruv  tushardhruvenroncom  Source The Hindu httpwwwhinduonnetcom Dabhol and the do nothing Government By Prem Shankar Jha Ever since the Vajpayees Government came to power more than two and a half years ago the economy has been sliding relentlessly into the deepest recession it has ever known In the nine months since December industrial growth has averaged 17 per cent The decade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months only five years ago when it touched 162 per cent are now but a distant memory Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11 terrorist strikes in the US It has now shrunk dramatically -vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TV sets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent With no demand to power it inflation measured by the consumer price index has fallen almost to zero The share market is dead and there is no fresh investment Employment in the organised sector is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human memory In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to find a place however humble in the organised sector of the economy but been turned away By 2004 the number will have risen by another three million But Mr Yashwant Sinha is confident that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of the countrys problems But one recent event highlights the governments paralysis more sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do This is its failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the Maharashtra State Electricity Boardss attempt to foil Enrons bid to take it before an international arbitration court by claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase agreement The London Court correctly maintained that just as a governments international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law proceedings in an international court must take precedence over those in a domestic court The way has therefore been cleared for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an international tribunal for a breach of it contractual obligations Given the fearsome proficiency of Enrons lawyers both those whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase agreement it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB will lose the case If that happens then by a conservative estimate India will have to pay around 5 billion in costs and damages In addition it will have to spend a little more to complete phase II of the project Thus in the end the project is likely to cost not 3 billion but more like 52 to 54 billion For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has dragged on the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was simply a dispute between a State Government and a private company and it had no say in the matter That pretext in any case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues But today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable let alone willing to pay such an enormous penalty So the bill will inevitably land at the Centres door And that means the taxpayers door The Centre will have no option but to pay But having done so will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government The answer obviously is no What it will be forced to do is transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete and operate But since no one can possibly run a 5 billion power plant generating 2100 MW of power profitably the NTPC too will insist on the capital value of the project being substantially written down first Judging from the offers that the Tata Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply Company BSES were making to Enron the written down value will not exceed 2 billion Thus whichever way we look at it the country will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant 3 billion without getting a single watt of electricity or for that matter anything else in return None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao government agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis Nor is it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning the latters inability under law to pay backup charges at more than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants would have been exposed long ago But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify even greater mistakes in the future For better or for worse the Enron deal was struck and it was struck not once but twice As a serious responsible government that knows the importance of honouring ones word in a world where contract is king the Vajpayee Government must honour the countrys contractual obligations This does not in any way preclude its trying to alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not see but by definition all future changes must be by mutual consent The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhols power affordable are known to all As the 1995 Renegotiating Committee and the Godbole Committee recommended the Government should buy the 800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a separate company that can supply gas to all the current and future users on the west coast In fact it could go one better and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage the plant This is entirely feasible because its installed capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need This will bring down the capital cost upon which backup charges and cost per unit of power will be calculated to 22 billion Second the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of the equity in Dabhol from the promoters This was negotiated with the 1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign exchange to 19 billion and the debt portion whose servicing represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to 12 billion The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee debt That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity tariffs to changes in the exchange rate With the price of oil having fallen for India to around 20 a barrel these changes will bring down the cost of Dabhols power at 90 per cent capacity utilisation own to below Rs 240 a unit This will make it entirely viable especially if Maharashtra and the neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and reduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be to take over the project from the MSEB renegotiate it with Enron or if Enron wants to opt out then buy the project from it at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before handing it over to the NTPC Getting dragged to court will neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhols power nor answer the more basic question - how can any electricity grid add new power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it charges for electricity

Heffron Kevin Hutchinson Mi chael Jones Timothy Lynch Drew Subject09EML Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Jeff  John We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals  Limited EML As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint Aft er your review we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss If you co ncur with the actions suggested please advise  If there is any balance sh eet debtorcreditor or cash forecast information that you require please  let us know Drew Lynch Kevin Heffron Jonathan Marsh and Joe Gold Introduction Enron Metals Limited  EML maintains a unique position within Enron Corp  EML is one of Enrons two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service s Authority FSA - the UK financial regulator and Enrons only remaining b rokerage business  Given its special status EML has responsibilities to i ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L ME metals exchange of which it is a member  As a result of this regulato ry oversight there are several differences between EML and Enrons other b usinesses 109EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato ry rules relating among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus iness Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers 209By virtue of its position as an LME broker there are certain circumst ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients  EMLs p olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible however EMLs cond uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship to exist  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th e FSA and the LME 309Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an d to protect against systemic risk EMLs position as a provider of liquidi ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME As a co nsequence of this concern the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain  prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi tion and credit risk The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA  regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem ent These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital which can be  used by way of regulatory capital and a breach of these rules is regarded  as extremely serious An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c ease carrying on business 409EMLs board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for a breach of the rules Penalties for individuals include significant fines and possible expulsion from the industry The duties owed by board members under the FSAs rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r elating to directors duties Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem onstrate to the FSA that to the full extent possible the financial streng th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t he rest of Enron  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation  we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below Issues Surrounding Liquidity As we are all aware over the past week as a result of the reputation probl ems the corporation has been faced with we have substantially increased th e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML  This was a precautio n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML  Clearly the  goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing  of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t he non-EML related problems of Enron  This of course needed to be accompli shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was concerned 20 The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains and distributes its cash  In the event that cash is lent outside of EML it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap ital of the firm however the firm has a number of options to preserve its day to day liquidity20 20 In its position as an LME broker EML must have access to cash for two purp oses  First it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House  LCH  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater al to the LCH it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc ement action could ensue In addition it would be declared a defaulter and  the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions  Second it must be able to post margin to its clients  A failure to make a contractu al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre d to the FSA  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-money clients in the event that they wish to close their account  While th ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr ofits the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest ions Previously we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity However ce rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to  fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from the rest of Enron has become a concern  EML has or is in the process of l osing 60000000 of unsecured LCs which were primarily used in lieu of c ash at the LCH  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC s  Additionally a number of clients have requested that their accounts be transferred  Those transfers have reduced EMLs cash balance  Was the re maining 50 mm unsecured LC which has been issued by a single bank to be  withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid ity impact The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality  Therefore we have  agreed to start to do the following a09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t he rest of the enterprise b09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel c09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints of continuing to do business on a normal basis d09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basis e09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity f09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis Operational Risk 20 In theory EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account s and rely on Enron Corp for the remaining portion of its day to day cash  needs  EMLs board have been resistant to this practice for several very p ractical reasons  First it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis  I f EML relied on Enron Corps daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs  it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp or an acco unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either capital or liquidity events as EMLs clearing account at Citibank would be substantially overdrawn  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi ght create a cascade for Enron EMLs board is reluctant to put that much f aith in the 100 accuracy of our operational safeguards Capital As noted above EML is subject to the FSAs regulatory capital rules and mu st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis  The FSA requires th at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110 of the minimum finan cial resources requirement  For a variety of reasons there were occasions when EML violated the 110 threshold on occasions in 2001 Because these v iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain s financial resources in excess of 120 so that it has a sufficient buffer  not to trigger the FSA notification requirement In the current climate the FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari se from Enrons perceived financial weakness Accordingly if one of those  violations occurred today the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM Ls cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily  basis EMLs board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev el of 130  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces s capital adequacy go hand in hand 20 Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce narios which would cause liquidity issues for EML 109Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH 209Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH 309Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME  brokers 409Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly20 509Credit exposures leading to credit losses Recommendations The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov erall operational liquidity 109To fully draw down the remaining 25 mm available under the  125 mm s ubordinated facility 209To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions 20 mm 309To increase the subordinated facility to 175 mm and extend the maturi ty by six months to July 2002 409To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi ts and other assets held by EML 509To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol d for calling margin 609To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients other th an a select group of key relationship clients20 709To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c ompanies EMCL and EMCC therefore shifting the need for inventory finance Current Situation Unsecured Guaranty09090965 mm Secured Guaranty09090915 mm Subordinated Loans090909107 mm EML Cash Balance09090959 mm Cash required to replace Withdrawn guaranty09090920mm EML Regulatory Capital Level09128 Excess Reg Capital over 1100930 mm Conclusion The attached financial analysis shows the result of the initial stress test ing The analysis shows certain low probability sets of circumstances where we w ould have liquidity issues  Given these possible eventualities we would ur ge that we move forward on points noted in bold above in addition to comple ting point f in the Issues Surrounding Liquidity Section

       the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work -        that I was making jobapplications by company email Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment As a manager Mr Bezanis has -        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval -        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance PRC process which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers and clients by review  Until now Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results -        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an energy index as a potential useful trading instrument  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite but the reaction of Mr Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first  I was banned by him from developing the idea further Discrimination It is our belief that Mr Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees especially competent women as equals  His rough stifling and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms Courtney Campbell the other only woman reporting to him Hostile Working Environment The working environment under Mr Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence  We are managed by threats rather than constructive comments Wrongful Termination Knowing I was unfairly treated Enron HR has not helped address my concerns  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process  Ms Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers no matter how wrong they are  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case Yours sincerely Mingcheng Lian

---------------------------rasheed mohammed mhrasheed2001yahoocom on 03202001 043224 PM To	jeffskillingenroncom cc Subject	URGENT RESPONSE REQUIRED Dear Friend I am Dr Rasheed Mohammed the newly appointed head of the Foreign Remittance Department in the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN I got your contact from a business directory of your country and based on your business activities and the type of investment I have in mind I found you to be the most suitable person for the transaction stated below Before I proceed I want to strongly advice that you devoid yourself from the general conception you have about Nigerians I would like you to carefully study this proposal without bias since it would be relevant in our lives It is a usual practice in Nigeria for ministers and high-ranking government officials to divert governments money into their private accounts this is usually done through CBN with the connivance of senior officials The ministers and military generals especially during the era of late general sani Abacha achieve this by diverting most of the funds meant for the development of their respective agencies and ministries into the CBN escrow accounts Usually it is this same escrow account that holds funds for the payment of foreign contracts  With the help of the inside officials the minister or senior government officials and military generals would now create themselves or employ the assistance of a foreign partner to create them as artificial contractors using fiticious documents to remit the deposited money to the nominated bank account of their foreign partners In this case the money is treated as payment for foreign contract and there is no trace This is how federal governments money is siphoned on a regular basis to the extent that most people now result to letter scams and fraud due to the knowledge they have about it Due to the impromptu removal of my successor from the central bank he did not have enough time to perfect and tidy up the transactions they have in place So the funds are now trapped at the central bank escrow account with no records I just discovered this in a bid to fulfill my obligation to submit the state of our escrow account to the federal government and the governor of CBN before I commence any foreign payment I am conducting a sort of reconciliation of our escrow account to declare to the government the total amount that have been spent in the last three years and what it was spent for So  in the course of carrying out the above exercise I discovered a total sum of 150MILLION in the escrow account that is unknown to anyone and with no records My intention is to reveal about USD 100M to the federal government so that I can be in his good books and make arrangement to transfer the outstanding USD 50M into a safe account abroad It is based on this that I am making this urgent contact with you However I am doing this because of the nature of my job I am a civil servant that is poorly paid and more so there is no way I can remain in this office forever I have children to cater for even when I retire as the director which is just next year So I need something tangible to fall back on when I retire Besides if I declare the total funds to the government it would probably go into the pockets of a few people that control the government This is to enlighten you on the degree of corruption in Nigeria So do not blame me for my action because you would do the same if you were in my shoes knowing fully well that there will be no compensation even if you disclose everything to the government Well I have discovered that I can transfer this money if we could quickly create you as an artificial contractor by using your company document and Bank account to receive the money in the same way my successor transferred theirs The only difference is that the final payment is going to be made to your named company through any of our correspondent payment center in Europe or America due to the policies adopted by the new democratic government The entire process is not easy but it is achievable due to my position in the foreign remittance department of the CBN and the relationship I have with the present director of external payment and finance of the federal ministry of finance The entire operation will be between the three of us I I shall take care of all documentation ii My friend in the federal ministry of finance will take care of all lobbying and use of influence to get all documentation iii You shall take care of the banking arrangements provide the needed invoices to enable us apply for claims and approvals and travel as the beneficiary to receive the funds from the payment center you shall be paid from After we have succeeded in transferring this funds 20 shall be retained by you for your assistance 5 for the settlement of all debts we might incur in the course of this transaction and the remaining 75 shall be for me and my colleague which we would possibly invest in into your company or any viable business venture you suggest If you are comfortable with this programme please revert to me at once via telephone number 234-1-7593507 or fax number 234-1-7590440 Should your response be positive I would then instruct on the next step to take Due to security reasons when you call do not ask for any name simply ask me to reconfirm the telephone number Once I reconfirm my number to be 234-1-7593507 you can then mention my name before you go into any discussion If I fail to reply correctly do not wait for a second trial just drop the phone and call back later We demand a quick response from you Any delay might result in contacting someone else Irrespective of what happens we count on your maturity to keep the transaction to yourself So you are advised to treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality Looking forward to your urgent response Yours faithfully Dr Rasheed Mohammed Do You Yahoo Get email at your own domain with Yahoo Mail

Steven Subject	Re PEER GROUP MAPPING Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly within a four peer group structure  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Govt public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Govtpublic  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities net income these individuals should be moved to specialized technicaland others who are performing a less strategic function who should remain in the commercial support category With that said it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt If we stay with the four group stucture I intend to push hard for the remapping of Govt Affairs by year-end On a completely seperate issue I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the preferred distribution  relative to the bottom category for  commercial support groupsIm not implying this isnt an issue for commercial groups- I just dont have the same ability to assess the impact therethe concern simply stated  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a preferred distribution are quite highand that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour Thanks Enron Energy Services  From  David W Delainey  EES                           05102001 1026 AM Sent by	Kay ChapmanEES To	David

GROUP MAPPING Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3 It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups All functionsactivities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached The actions points from this excercise are 1	to review and agree the attached mapping 2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment 3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25 To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VPMD PRC Meetings  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of

msmith1enroncom Sanders Richard Williams Robert C Vsharpenroncom Subject  Teamwork Hi Jim--The last month or so have been so hectic I have barely had time to breath  We have gone from fire to fire  Over the last 24 hours since we submitted our last hurry up brief I have been reflecting on the experience  To say it has been positive is an understatement Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual pressure--with so much  on the line--would have been stressful  However when you work with Enron the opposite is true  There is such a sense of esprit d corp that permeates your organization  It makes difficult things easy and the impossible just another day in the office There are no egos to trip over at Enron  When there is a problem to solve it is everyones problem  People are not afraid of asking questions  They keep questioning until they understand  Nobody minds repeating themselves  They are incredibly patient with outside lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed  As you well know yours is not a simple business  It is so refreshing There are so many benefits to this team approach 1  You get things right the first time  As you know in any litigation is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth Because you get things right the first time  the company is not exposed to being discredited when the other side responds 2  I would bet that Enrons outside legal bills are half what they would be otherwise  With most companies the outside and inside lawyers get a minimum of support from the business people  The business people view business as business and lawsuits as an annoyance  I should say that I could never understand that given the direct  Perhaps it is the trader mentality at the company  Perhaps it is an unwavering focus on the bottom line  Perhaps it is just that everyone feels they are a part of a team and they realize that by working together the team can achieve things that no one person can do working alone  Whatever the reason the outside lawyers job is made so much easier  That results in much much lower legal bills 3 You increase your chances of winning  The brainstorming is so valuable 4 The outside lawyers like me feel they are part of the team Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial  They can ask the dumb questions  I know that all of us here are looking forward to the next opportunity to work with the Enron team 5  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are choices to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron assignment goes to the top more often than not You have built a great legal team  All of your legal staff should be proud of what they have built Thanks for letting us come along for the ride Regards Bill A William

       the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work -        that I was making jobapplications by company email Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment As a manager Mr Bezanis has -        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval -        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance PRC process which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers and clients by review  Until now Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results -        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an energy index as a potential useful trading instrument  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite but the reaction of Mr Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first  I was banned by him from developing the idea further Discrimination It is our belief that Mr Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees especially competent women as equals  His rough stifling and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms Courtney Campbell the other only woman reporting to him Hostile Working Environment The working environment under Mr Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence  We are managed by threats rather than constructive comments Wrongful Termination Knowing I was unfairly treated Enron HR has not helped address my concerns  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process  Ms Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers no matter how wrong they are  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case Yours sincerely Mingcheng Lian

---------------------------rasheed mohammed mhrasheed2001yahoocom on 03202001 043224 PM To	jeffskillingenroncom cc Subject	URGENT RESPONSE REQUIRED Dear Friend I am Dr Rasheed Mohammed the newly appointed head of the Foreign Remittance Department in the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN I got your contact from a business directory of your country and based on your business activities and the type of investment I have in mind I found you to be the most suitable person for the transaction stated below Before I proceed I want to strongly advice that you devoid yourself from the general conception you have about Nigerians I would like you to carefully study this proposal without bias since it would be relevant in our lives It is a usual practice in Nigeria for ministers and high-ranking government officials to divert governments money into their private accounts this is usually done through CBN with the connivance of senior officials The ministers and military generals especially during the era of late general sani Abacha achieve this by diverting most of the funds meant for the development of their respective agencies and ministries into the CBN escrow accounts Usually it is this same escrow account that holds funds for the payment of foreign contracts  With the help of the inside officials the minister or senior government officials and military generals would now create themselves or employ the assistance of a foreign partner to create them as artificial contractors using fiticious documents to remit the deposited money to the nominated bank account of their foreign partners In this case the money is treated as payment for foreign contract and there is no trace This is how federal governments money is siphoned on a regular basis to the extent that most people now result to letter scams and fraud due to the knowledge they have about it Due to the impromptu removal of my successor from the central bank he did not have enough time to perfect and tidy up the transactions they have in place So the funds are now trapped at the central bank escrow account with no records I just discovered this in a bid to fulfill my obligation to submit the state of our escrow account to the federal government and the governor of CBN before I commence any foreign payment I am conducting a sort of reconciliation of our escrow account to declare to the government the total amount that have been spent in the last three years and what it was spent for So  in the course of carrying out the above exercise I discovered a total sum of 150MILLION in the escrow account that is unknown to anyone and with no records My intention is to reveal about USD 100M to the federal government so that I can be in his good books and make arrangement to transfer the outstanding USD 50M into a safe account abroad It is based on this that I am making this urgent contact with you However I am doing this because of the nature of my job I am a civil servant that is poorly paid and more so there is no way I can remain in this office forever I have children to cater for even when I retire as the director which is just next year So I need something tangible to fall back on when I retire Besides if I declare the total funds to the government it would probably go into the pockets of a few people that control the government This is to enlighten you on the degree of corruption in Nigeria So do not blame me for my action because you would do the same if you were in my shoes knowing fully well that there will be no compensation even if you disclose everything to the government Well I have discovered that I can transfer this money if we could quickly create you as an artificial contractor by using your company document and Bank account to receive the money in the same way my successor transferred theirs The only difference is that the final payment is going to be made to your named company through any of our correspondent payment center in Europe or America due to the policies adopted by the new democratic government The entire process is not easy but it is achievable due to my position in the foreign remittance department of the CBN and the relationship I have

appear to have been racing to sell ENE shares because of its apparent high PE multiple ignoring the considerable value of segments including Enron Energy Services telecom and non-energy wholesale services and misconceptions about a number of issues including its stalled asset disposition program the Portland General Electric sale could be significantly delayed the market position of its Indian power plant and California energy issues  We believe that the current period of perceived uncertainly is actually an excellent opportunity to buy into a company that we view as virtually unique in the economy  We believe that the energy industry in the United States and world is undergoing a major transformation and that a very few companies led by Enron are positioned to create efficiencies and provide the products services and flexibility required by customers  We believe these opportunities will lead to growth in earnings of 25 over the long term even if telecommunications makes only slow progress and does not come close to reaching our expectations   Enron is likely to report strong results in Q1 and 2001 from all core businesses  Although mgmt indicated on its March 23rd conf call that it was very comfortable with  ests of 170 to 175 we continue to be very confident that the company will equal or exceed our 180 estimate  Wholesale Services is likely to have an outstanding quarter according to CEO Jeff Skilling with a 25 to 35 increase in natural gas volumes and a doubling of financial volumes  Retail appears on track to achieve its 30 billion of new contract signings and turn profitable in 2001 on a fully allocated basis  Telecom has progressed at a slower pace than expected by investors as bandwidth trading has turned out to be more complicated to implement than some believed and the content business now without Blockbuster as a partner appears to also be developing more slowly than implied by Enron in 2000  This said the business opportunities in both parts of telecom appear to be excellent Important Disclosures code definitions attached or available upon request ENE         US 5810 CF CP M

especially to current and incoming students  The University could serve many more students if students moved through their college program in a shorter time  College costs would diminish and earning capacity would increase I have just returned from a wonderful visit to Midland where Advisory Council Vice-Chair Brian McLaughlin made sure I saw all that his hometown has to offer  We talked with prospective students at the Trinity School and at Midland High School and Lee High School had lunch with fellow Advisory Council member Cadell Liedtke and even visited the Haley Library Successes abound  S Gail Caldwell American Studies MA and BA alumna was just awarded a Pulitzer Prize in the area of Distinguished Criticism for her insightful observations on contemporary life and literature in The Boston Globe  A cash award of 7500 accompanies the prize Congratulations A trumpet fanfare a classroom takeover and a Texas-size check -- the annual surprise Friar Centennial Teaching Fellowship goes to our own Associate Dean Larry Carver  The Friar Society is UT Austins oldest and most respected honor society seeking to recognize professors who reach out to undergraduate students in ways that exemplify true dedication  Carver was chosen because he reaches students in his classroom through his tireless efforts to ensure that material is accessible interesting and relevant  He challenges students to revel in great books  With the award comes a check for 12000   which comes with the condition that the professor cancel class upon receipt of the check  Larry assures me that some of the award will be used to increase the Pinto Carver Scholarship the only endowment at the University named for a cat   See longer story with pictures at httpwwwutexaseducolanewsreleasescarverhtml Philosophy professor Alex Mourelatos has been inducted into the Academy of Athens which cited his role in creating at UT a model program the joint classicsphilosophy graduate program in ancient philosophy which was launched in 1967  This is the highest honor bestowed in Greece on scientists and scholars in the fine arts and letters As students prepare for a summer in Winedale learning Shakespeare in the most hands-on way possible a new steering committee has been formed to raise endowment funds to support this program in perpetuity  Members are Mike  Penny Cies Greg  Brenda Hemphill Royce  Elva Keilers J Mark Metts Dick and Judy Perkins Ernie  Mary Gayle Stromberger Eric  Laura Thomas Peyton  Carolyn Townsend and Barbara  Milt Williams who will host the groups meeting at their restored home in Winedale early in June   Contact Clare Hudspeth at 512 471-8861 if you want to help or make a gift For those of you lucky enough to have been taught Shakespeare by James B Ayres PhD Shakespeare at Winedale Regents Professor you might want to send him a note of congratulations -

To my friends and colleagues20 After 27 years with Houston Pipe Line Company under the successiv e ownership of HNG InterNorth Enron and now AEP Ive decided to try so mething different  As of September 30 I will no longer be getting up and  driving downtown to work every day  Much has happened in 2001 on personal  family professional national and global levels which has induced me t o act on my inclination to retire Ive been thinking about it ever since I got that solicitation from AARP  There is much that I will miss daily c amaraderie with co-workers and colleagues challenging work interesting pr ojects a paycheck but there are other things that I can do without rush hour traffic cumbersome regulations long hours irreconcilable conflicts  office politics tedious paperwork seemingly endless meetings payroll d eductions  On balance it looks like a fair trade20 I have enjoyed the very good fortune of having a challenging and sa tisfying career and of having been able to do so in the company of many wo nderful people  I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for your friendship and support over the years for contributing to my never-ending education and for being a valued part of my experiences and memories  Th ere have been a lot of good times and some less good times but I wouldnt want to start all over again and see how it turns out next time around  I am enormously grateful for all of my many blessings and hopefully the sam e is true for you  20 My general plan for right now is to contemplate the future and my p lace in it which sound pretty good to me -- both the process of contemplat ion as well as the future itself  I do intend to find some arguably produc tive andor fun ways to spend my new otherwise idle time and finding out w hat those may be should be half the fun  Perhaps the biggest concern is ho w long Linda will be able to tolerate my not getting up and leaving the hou se every weekday morning but shes at the church a lot of the time anyway Im sure the boys are wondering how my being around the house more will a ffect their tranquility and privacy and that remains to be seen although  I doubt that Ill be hanging out with them and their friends very much anyw ay20 One of my specific resolutions as we go forward is to do a better j ob of keeping up with friends  The wonders of e-mail will facilitate that  endeavor but I will also be available in person for lunches happy hours  tee times dinners movies and other consultations I already know where t o find you reciprocally my contact information will now be tsheltontaol com 3507 Plumb Houston TX 77005 phone 713-665-5315 and fax 713-665-741 0  As time goes on I may self-indulgently send e-mail updates if you con sider them spam you know where the Delete button is20 Linda and I will be out of town on a trip to New England next week but when we return I will commence a substantially different way of life  I am eagerly anticipating whatever the future may hold  Like most people Im anxious to spend more time with my family they may be a little anxiou s about that too  Myriads of exciting new opportunities and challenges u ndoubtedly await and Im looking forward to discovering and pursuing many  of them  The list of things I want or need to do is already quite long an d will likely grow even faster than I can check things off the list20 As for the very immediate future Im going to click on Send pic k up my briefcase and head for the elevator  We have to get ready to go t o Brians volleyball tournament in Dallas tomorrow  So long for now best  wishes and see ya around

C Vsharpenroncom Subject  Teamwork Hi Jim--The last month or so have been so hectic I have barely had time to breath  We have gone from fire to fire  Over the last 24 hours since we submitted our last hurry up brief I have been reflecting on the experience  To say it has been positive is an understatement Under ordinary circumstances working under such continual pressure--with so much  on the line--would have been stressful  However when you work with Enron the opposite is true  There is such a sense of esprit d corp that permeates your organization  It makes difficult things easy and the impossible just another day in the office There are no egos to trip over at Enron  When there is a problem to solve it is everyones problem  People are not afraid of asking questions  They keep questioning until they understand  Nobody minds repeating themselves  They are incredibly patient with outside lawyers--spending hours and hours bringing us up to speed  As you well know yours is not a simple business  It is so refreshing There are so many benefits to this team approach 1  You get things right the first time  As you know in any litigation is critical that the court view your side as the teller of truth Because you get things right the first time  the company is not exposed to being discredited when the other side responds 2  I would bet that Enrons outside legal bills are half what they would be otherwise  With most companies the outside and inside lawyers get a minimum of support from the business people  The business people view business as business and lawsuits as an annoyance  I should say that I could never understand that given the direct Perhaps it is the trader mentality at the company  Perhaps it is an unwavering focus on the bottom line  Perhaps it is just that everyone feels they are a part of a team and they realize that by working together the team can achieve things that no one person can do working alone  Whatever the reason the outside lawyers job is made so much easier  That results in much much lower legal bills 3 You increase your chances of winning  The brainstorming is so valuable 4 The outside lawyers like me feel they are part of the team Outside lawyers do not feel as if they are on trial  They can ask the dumb questions  I know that all of us here are looking forward to the next opportunity to work with the Enron team 5  Human nature being what it is--I think that when there are choices to be made as to whose work goes on the top of the pile--the Enron assignment goes to the top more often than not You have built a great legal team  All of your legal staff should be proud of what they have built Thanks for letting us come along for the ride Regards Bill A William Urquhart Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges LLP 865

over Enron for 700-800m FYI the Economic Times in India has published the following article which suggests details of a DPC buy-out  While this article does not accurately reflect the reception Wade Cline has been receiving in Delhi it may be a  trial balloon by the Prime Ministers office to gauge public reaction  Dow Jones has already carried a shortened version of the story a copy of whic h appears at the bottom of this e-mail  We are using the following stateme nt to respond to media inquiries Media Statement20 DPC continues to hold discussions with GoI IFIs regarding the sale of for eign sponsor equity in the Dabhol project It would not be appropriate to e laborate further on the recurring media speculation with respect to the sta tus of these buyout discussions20 While we remain hopeful for an amicable resolution of this issue DPC conti nues to pursue the available legal remedies under the contract documents in order to protect the interests of DPCs stakeholders 20 ECONOMIC TIMES Tuesday October 30 200120 Enron nears deal to sell DPC to IFIs at 30 discount20 IFIs may take over Enron for 700-800m Shubhrangshu Roy20 US power giant Enron is in advanced stages of negotiations to dispose of it s controversial Indian venture Dabhol Power Company at a 30 per cent discou nt to the financial institutions at a price of 700-800 million20 Enron and the FIs led by the Industrial Development Bank of India are sai d to be close to finalising a broad agreement to this effect in the next fe w days The final settlement should be worked out before Prime Minister Ata l Bihari Vajpayee leaves for the US in the second week of November Should  the deal go through Enron is likely to settle for a five-year payment plan in equal instalments to minimise a heavy one-time foreign exchange outgo  Enron claims its financial exposure in DPC is over 1 billion It had earli er insisted that it be paid this sum for any out-of-court settlement and to enable its exit from India Now it is likely to settle for a lesser amount  that is in the excess of 700 million but definitely lower than 800 mil lion which is its actual equity exposure in DPC Sources close to the ongo ing negotiations say that the government is eager that the FIs take over DP C quickly so that the Prime Minister can tell US President George W Bush du ring his forthcoming visit to Washington that justice has been done to the  power major20 Enron chairman Kenneth Lay known to be close to the US President was the  biggest donor to Bushs campaign kitty A settlement of the Enron imbroglio  being played out since early this year is seen to be important to enhanc ing Indias political relationship with the US The government is keen that the FIs take over DPC to avoid prolonged negotiations on a settlement that would be necessary if a private Indian promoter were to step in So far B SES and Tata Power have evinced interest in taking over DPC but their offe r prices are said to be too low The FIs on the other hand are keen on an early settlement as they have a huge loan exposure of over Rs 6200 crore Should the FIs take over the company they are expected to warehouse the p roject before selling it to a private buyer This is expected to take at le ast 90 days20 Any prospective private sector buyer would need at least a month to underta ke a proper due diligence of DPCs accounts Thereafter the FIs could take at least another 30 days to make an open offer and another month to close  the sale with a private bidder or the State-owned National Thermal Power Co rporation20 Sources say of the 1-billion-plus exposure claimed by Enron in DPC Enron s equity exposure -- along with its US partners GE and Bechtel -- is 800 m illion The company also claims to have spent around 200 million as devel opment expenditure and around 140 million by way of retained earnings 20 NEW DELHI -Dow Jones- US energy company Enron Corp ENE is in an adva nced stage of negotiations to sell its Indian unit Dabhol Power Co at a  30 discount to financial institutions at a price likely between 700 milli on-800 million reports the Economic Times quoting unnamed sources20 The business daily says Enron and the financial institutions led by the In dustrial Development Bank of India PIDB are close to finalizing a broad agreement within the next few days The final settlement should be worked  out before Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee leaves for the US i n the second week of November according to the report Should the deal go through Enron is likely to settle for a five-year payme

State Public Service Commission for approval If the merger closes it would result in net customer savings of about 1 billion over the next 10 years compared with rates projected without the merger  Also as part of the agreement the companies would expand Niagara Mohawks annual Upstate New York economic development efforts by 125 million Niagara Mohawks merger with National Grid will allow us to reduce and stabilize energy delivery costs and enhance our commitment to economic development in the communities we serve said William F Edwards Niagara Mohawks senior vice president and chief financial officer  We believe this agreement will provide significant benefits to Upstate customers and to the economy The rate cuts low-income protection and other benefits agreed to in this plan will help National Grid fulfill our commitment to become a positive presence in Upstate New York said Lawrence Reilly senior vice president and general counsel for National Grid USA The significant size of the merged companies will provide us with the resources and skills necessary to deliver first-rate customer service while being a low-cost provider of electricity and natural gas service he said He added that the agreement details a comprehensive service quality plan under which customer safety reliability and service will be maintained and enhanced after the merger  The plan calls for up to 24 million in annual penalties  or more under certain conditions  if defined customer service and reliability goals arent achieved Niagara Mohawks actual costs for delivery of electricity are expected to drop by more than 8 percent through the merger  When those savings are applied to a customers entire electricity bill  which also includes the cost of electricity purchased  the net savings are projected to equal 5 percent The reduction would be implemented upon consummation of the merger At that time todays agreement calls for customers delivery charges to be immediately reduced by approximately 160 million  After that decrease delivery charges would remain stabilized for 10 years subject to limited adjustments  In addition the companies would forgo collection of approximately 850 million in nuclear costs that otherwise would have been collected from customers The long-term proposal has a number of other initiatives including     Price-stabilized electricity commodity service for residential and small commercial customers for several years providing those customers with significant protection from any major fluctuations in the generation marketplace     The extension by 16 months of a multi-year gas rate settlement resulting in gas delivery rates -- unchanged since 1996 -- remaining the same through December 2004     The extension of the Low-Income Customer Assistance Program which was expanded under Niagara Mohawks existing regulatory agreement with the PSC and the development of a special rate for eligible low-income customers     The establishment of electricity choice educational programs targeted to customers and energy service companies     Environmental benefits such as interconnection assistance for wind power sources support for green power marketing and the continued sale of surplus land for preservation The agreement culminates five months of negotiations among Niagara Mohawk National Grid the Department of Public Service staff and other parties including large industrial customers energy service companies and various state agencies This joint proposal continues the recent downward trend in Niagara Mohawks delivery rates for businesses and provides additional rate and service options for those customers all of which should enhance business expansion and economic development across Upstate New York said Robert Loughney on behalf of Multiple Intervenors a trade association representing the interests of the states largest commercial and industrial employers The proposed settlement is supported by two major national environmental groups the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense  It also is supported by the American Wind Energy Association and by Community Energy a green power marketing company The merger agreement benefits the environment and the economy by providing customers with an easy way to purchase renewable energy products on their electricity bill and by stimulating a large new investment in wind energy generation in Upstate New York said David Wooley counsel for the four environmental interests  In this proposal National Grid demonstrates that it intends to continue Niagara Mohawks established record of responsible environmental stewardship A leading advocacy group for low-income customers also supports the joint settlement proposal Specifically and positively addressed in this proposal are the needs of many customers who struggle to make ends meet said Ben Wiles an attorney for the Public Utility Law Project  The opportunity created by the merger of National Grid USA and Niagara Mohawk will result in a special reduced rate for as many as 60000 eligible low-income customers  It also will expand Niagara Mohawks safety net program to allow more people to receive assistance Among the other parties to sign the settlement was the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 97 which represents Niagara Mohawks unionized work force  In addition the Distributed Generation Power Coalition energy marketers energy services companies and regional economic development agencies support the settlement proposal The companies have asked that the matter be considered at the PSCs Nov 28 meeting  The merger also is subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc is an investor-owned energy services company that provides electricity to more than 15 million customers across 24000 square miles of Upstate New York  The company also delivers natural gas to more than 540000 customers over 4500 square miles of eastern central and northern New York National Grid USA includes local electric companies Massachusetts Electric Narragansett Electric Granite State Electric Nantucket Electric and a substantial transmission business  Its parent company National Grid Group plc builds owns and operates electric and telecommunications networks around the world NOTE  This

Derrick Thought you might be interested in the report I prepared for people who pledged to MS in connection with the bike ride over the weekend Several persons who have either pledged or are considering a pledge to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society have left messages or sent emails asking if I am still alive after the MS150 charity bike ride held this past weekend Others have asked for a report of my experience I am alive and sore If you are not interested in the report please delete this email First of all for those who have pledged or already sent you checks payable to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society  thanks is an inadequate word Remember that you are helping colleagues and others and perhaps yourself with your contributions This bike ride charity event turned out to be a story unlike anything I ever expected Here is my story if you are interested BASIC FACTS 1  I did show up for the bike ride 530 am Saturday 2  I did start the bike ride 710 am with approximately 9400 bikers in the largest charity bike ride in the country 3  I did ride my bike across the finish line in Austin the following day some 199 miles down the road 4  I did either ride my bike or push it up several hills for approx 182 miles of the 199 mile route 5  I crossed the finish line in Austin only a few minutes before the deadline of 600 pm on Sunday 6  I ended up meeting in one way or another almost every biker on the trip That resulted from the fact that I started at almost the very front of the pack of 9400 bike riders and was passed by nearly all of them before I reached Austin 7  I am extremely pleased to have participated in the event  I dont have the time to participate in such events very often and I was fortunate to have a schedule which opened up just in time for me to enter this event RANDOM GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 1  The charity event title MS150 is a misnomer  When I signed up for this event I understood the 150 part of the event title to refer to the mileage between Houston and Austin I was wrong  The 150 I now understand to mean the approximate number of blisters to be found on ones posterior when a biker crosses the finish line 2  I have driven from Houston to Austin many times in the past  There are routes between the two cities that are generally flat with hills of a gentle grade  We took a different route 3  The ride from Houston to Austin by car is about 160 miles The route we took was almost 40 miles further  The bike ride route displayed on a map appeared similar to that which you might expect to be drawn by asking an Aggie to find the shortest distance between two points 4  Road kill if far more attractive from a car than from a bike 5  The chicken ranch in LaGrange is long gone but the spirit lingers  The LaGrange fair gounds was the venue for dinner and lodging at the end of the first day of biking We were welcomed there by the local Rotary Club volunteers with a scrumptuous dinner of barbecued chicken and salad with ranch dressing  I laughed out loud when I saw the meal being served and wondered whether the historical connection was intentional STRATEGY I knew when I signed up for this event that I had almost no chance of completing the ride which at the time I entered I thought was only 150 miles  I had not trained at all for the bike ride and was and am not physically fit and dont exercise as I should  The total extent of my bike riding during the year prior to the event was when rode my mountain bike from my home to a sporting goods store to buy supplies one week before the trip  Round trip my training ride to the sporting goods store was about 3 miles I sufficiently realistic to know that I needed a strategy to gain some advantage to make up for the lack of althletic readiness  I came up with what I thought was the perfect solution Before the race started I looked for the largest biker I could spot  My plan was that if I rode my bike during the ride immediately behind a very large person I could draft that person Nascar style and gain a considerable aerodynamic advantage  I thought it was a terrific idea and I figured that even if the large person had a slower pace than I desired the advantage would be apparent by the end of the ride  Luckily I found just the person I was seeking---this person appeared to be about 300-325 pounds--a body that would clear a nice swath of air for me to follow  When the race started I maneuvered my bike and pulled immediately behind the biker who was to be my air blocker   For the first 5 minutes of the ride my strategy worked great--I actually could tell that my air resistance was considerable less when I was directly behind this large person  Then the unexpected happened----my large person biker turned on her afterburners and left me in the dust  Never again on this bike ride was I again able to catch and draft another biker I needed a new strategy---perhaps a tail wind which did in fact materialize in spades  but not before noon the second day of the ride THE RIDE IN DETAIL I signed up for this event about two weeks in advance of the ride as a result of my schedule opening up unexpectedly when it was previously heavily commited  I did it largely on  a lark but the event took on new meaning when I learned of close friends who have been stricken with MS after I started the fund raising effort which is a required part of participating as a rider I knew I was out of shape and had been asked by friends if I had gone loco in even attempting this strenuous activity  I agreed that I could not keep up the normal pace of younger and far more physically fit bikers  So I made a pledge to myself  No matter what I was not going to overexert myself  I would establish a reasonable pace and not even get close to being winded  I succeeded in executing this plan until lunch on the first day of the ride I kept a pace that was clearly nonstrenous and I felt good about the ride for the first 4 hours or so which was mostly level road  I was very happy with the ride and was looking forward to the tasty box lunch that the announcer has promised at the start of the day was waiting for every biker when we reached Bellville about 50 miles from Houston  When I got to Bellville I came to realize that my pace although not strenous was substantially off the mark  With a box lunch prepared for over 9000 riders there were only four box lunches left when I arrived in Bellville As I thought back I remembered being passed by many bikers  I  did pass by my count 9 bikes before lunch as if they were standing still  They were They all had flat tires   I decided I needed to pick up the pace at little after lunch I headed out after a quick lunch to try to make up some time  By around 200 to 300 I was really getting tired and although still cautious about over exertion I was losing energy fast I stopped at a pay phone booth in a small town and called home I told my 13 year old son William I did not think I would make it much further  But I wanted to go as far as I could I rode about 10 more miles and was almost totally out of steam when I remember thinking I desparately need a long rest  About that time I looked up at a road sign that said Cemetery next exit  The symbolic connection was compelling  I decided it was time to take a rest--a temporary not a permanent one  I biked past the cemetery where I lay down in some high grass along the road to catch my breath The local chiggars and I bonded almost immediately  I then flagged down a SAG bus designed to pick up weary bikers and got help loading first my bike then my body into a van  I remember telling the driver that I was finished and that I did not think I could bike anymore for the rest of the way to Austin  I was extremely disappointed because I had gone only about 62 miles and about 80 of the donations pledged to me were based on distance traveled  I concluded I was destined to fall far short of my fundraising goal After traveling in the van for about 15 miles we came upon the entrance to a ranch of a friend of mine that I had visited only a couple weeks ago I asked the van driver to let me out so that I could see if my friend was home  I went to visit the friend but he was not at his ranch house and I ended up spending about an hour taking a nap while waiting for him  I finally decided to leave and found that the rest had given me new strength I thought I might be able to ride again  To make a long story short I rode for about another 4 hours straight until it was total dark  A van came and picked me up on the highway and told me it was too dark to continue I was only 3 miles short of LaGrange our stopover spot for the night and the van carried me on to this historic spot I had really been looking forward to reaching LaGrange because I was a member of Team Enron and Enrons hospitality for its bike riders was by reputation outstanding  They had hired 40 messeuses to give massages to the Team Enron bikers and a dinner fit for a king would be waiting Unfortunately by the time I arrived at the LaGrange Fair Grounds our accomodations for the evening dinner in the Enron tent was over and all the masseuses had vanished  I finally found a general meal service hosted by the local Rotarians who were serving barbecued chicken and a salad with ranch dressing Since I didnt enter the bike event until less than two weeks before it started Team Enrons private tent was full and I was relegated to find sleeping space on my own  I was directed to a huge feedlot covered with a large tin roof open air style no walls   As I nestled in my sleeping bag under the big roof with about 2000 other bikers my senses told me that I was probably to sleep where a cow going to market had probably slept only days before  But I was dog tired simply wanted to sleep and didnt have the energy to find less aeromatic alternative accomodations THE SECOND DAY I was told that breakfast would be served at 530 am the next morning and that the ride would start at sunup about 640 am  I concluded that I could sleep until 6 am grab a quick bite and still be at the starting gate by 640  Needless to say I was happy with my plan to get as much sleep as possible  I badly needed the rest My plan failed I did not take into consideration that I was sleeping among a bunch of gung-ho superbikejocks  About 4 am some two hours before I planned to wake up a large group of overenenergetic-supercyclists arose and started doing side straddle hops stretching and various exercises while making Monica Seles-like grunting noises  I was not amused  There was no way to go back to sleep The five hours of sleep I managed on Saturday night was wholly inadequate I was told that Day 2 of the bike ride was much more difficult than Day 1 because of the more hilly route as we approached Austin  To make a long story short  I actually gained strength on Day 2 as compared to Day 1 I actually learned some technique for transferring power from my arms to my legs and made it to Austin on my own power without any motorized help of any kind The ride through the hill country was spectacular  Also I did get a taste of ole country Texas along the way The bike route intentionally meanders via remote roads through small towns in order to avoid heavy highway traffic for the safety of the bikers  As we passed through one small town that I never heard of before I looked up to see a sign that said  THELMAS PLACE---POOL BEER DOMINOS A sign of equal size immediately adjacent said NO GUNS PERMITTED INSIDE  It was comforting to know that patrons of that establishment could drink peacefully while game playing knowing that customers are  required to go out to the parking lot to resolve domino disagreements where guns are not prohibited  I guess I have spent too much time in the major metropolitan areas of Texas and have forgotten about the genuine Texas back country There was one other noteworthy diversion  Cycling through Bastrop State Park is known to be one of the most strenous parts of the trip because of the extreme winding hills in this beautiful heavily-wooded area  The Park is also confusing because of its multiple intersecting roads through the park I was following another biker as we approached the park who was sporting a very fancy biking shirt on which was written TAM Cycling Club  I mentioned to him that I was not looking forward to entering Bastrop State Park because of the challenging steep hills  He responded that he knew a route through the park that was not only less hilly but was also 3 miles shorter than the route intended for the bikers  I was all ears to the prospect of a short cut and agreed to follow him on this less strenuous and shorter route  We entered the park and  for the next 10 miles according to my odometer it seemed like a roller coaster ride with turning steep inclines and dangerously steep and turning declines  Exactly one hour and ten minutes after we entered the park we finally exited the park--------------at the exact same place where we entered  I was exhausted and not amused  I should have known that an Aggie inherently is unable to find the shortest route to Austin To fast forward the story since this has been far too long already I made it to Austin on my own power and did not ask for a lift at all the second day  I was looking forward to getting a much needed shower when I arrived at the finishing line at the UT baseball stadium in Austin  I had put in my most strenuous effort during the last hour of the bike ride in the very hilly Austin area where every hill looks like Mount Everest or its kissing cousin  Unfortunately for the person who sat next to me on the bus coming back to Houston I was told just after crossing the finish line that the last bus would leave for Houston in only a few minutes and there was no time to shower  At that point in time I looked like I just stepped out of a sweat shower  The stranger next to me on the bus did exactly what I dreaded--he introduced himself and waited for a reply  I really didnt want this guy to know my name--the name  of the guy who was giving the bus the aroma of gymnasium locker room---- so after a moments thought I held out my still sweaty hand and proudly said Howdy my names Harry Reasoner Conclusion I participated in this event because I wanted to help my colleagues and others who are victims of MS  If you previously made one of those weirdo pledges that are impossible for anyone to calculate please send my secretary a check made payable to National Multiple Sclerosis Society in whatever amount makes you happy  If you have not made a donation wont you do so today You will benefit by giving as much as the people with MS who need your help  Thank you CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE The

racing to sell ENE shares because of its apparent high PE multiple ignoring the considerable value of segments including Enron Energy Services telecom and non-energy wholesale services and misconceptions about a number of issues including its stalled asset disposition program the Portland General Electric sale could be significantly delayed the market position of its Indian power plant and California energy issues  We believe that the current period of perceived uncertainly is actually an excellent opportunity to buy into a company that we view as virtually unique in the economy  We believe that the energy industry in the United States and world is undergoing a major transformation and that a very few companies led by Enron are positioned to create efficiencies and provide the products services and flexibility required by customers  We believe these opportunities will lead to growth in earnings of 25 over the long term even if telecommunications makes only slow progress and does not come close to reaching our expectations   Enron is likely to report strong results in Q1 and 2001 from all core businesses  Although mgmt indicated on its March 23rd conf call that it was very comfortable with  ests of 170 to 175 we continue to be very confident that the company will equal or exceed our 180 estimate  Wholesale Services is likely to have an outstanding quarter according to CEO Jeff Skilling with a 25 to 35 increase in natural gas volumes and a doubling of financial volumes  Retail appears on track to achieve its 30 billion of new contract signings and turn profitable in 2001 on a fully allocated basis  Telecom has progressed at a slower pace than expected by investors as bandwidth trading has turned out to be more complicated to implement than some believed and the content business now without Blockbuster as a partner appears to also be developing more slowly than implied by Enron in 2000  This said the business opportunities in both parts of telecom appear to be excellent Important Disclosures code definitions attached or available upon request ENE         US 5810 CF CP M

Cornell E-mail petercornellLinklaterscom SMTPenronXgate Subject  QCs Bruce Peter Sophie and I met with all four QCs this morning The clear choice in all of our minds is Jonathan Gaisman  See attached file Jonathan GaismandocHis litigation practice is prinicipally insurance related  He has done political risk insurance matters relating to Eastern Europe  He spoke definitively about practices of different underwriters in the market ie to re-insure to craft policies etc He knows quite well the small community of barristers who may be called upon by Lloyds to handle this  His wife is from India though Scottish and he spends holiday time there and knows the country and the people  He worked on North Sea disputes representing Enron in the past  He is straightforward inquisitive prepared thoughtful and interested in working on this with us  He is also used to working with large American clients  The downside is that in his words he does not have limitless time  He is expecting to be involved in a rather large case in the first half of next year Alistair Schaff was not a very seasoned barrister and unprepared for our meeting in the sense that he hadnt even bothered to read anything about us or the case before we got there  --  I did not get the sense he was too busy to do so  He has worked on de facto takings in Iraq cases and has had a number of cases that have involved questions of mitigation  In addition he seemed familiar with the option to sue clause in many policies  He has done some work in the distant past with the GOI on letters of credit and shipping matters  He was the only one that mentioned that we might spend some time in the near term thinking about what events we might cause to occur that could help our claims Richard Jacobs is a fairly young barrister but had read up on our case and did some preliminary research on case law on political risk insurance issues which incidentally all four barristers agree hardly exists  He did some PRI work in Russia in the early 1990s and represented brokers in a lender PRI claim regarding a South Seas power station He stated that many insurance coverage issues no matter the type of policy are basically the same questions with a different twist    Interestingly he has just given some advice to a European investor about a dispute in India on a power plant contractual matter not insurance related  He definitely grasped that a detailed review of the facts would be the driver for an expropriation claim  He has travelled to India  He has capacity to work with us in the next 4-8 weeks and beyond  He would be a solid guy to use as a back-up Stewart Boyd as you will recall from his CV is an experienced barrister 58 years old who sits as an international arbitrator often He has a relationship with Lord Mustill for what that is worth  He does alot of insurance and re-insurance work though he says that not many political risk insurance cases have reached the bar  He has worked on a leading case involving ECGD and was interestingly an expert witness in an OPIC coverage case recently  We may consider him for just that role on the DIC issue should we decide to sue in Texas He has dealt with many projects of this type and magnitude from a contractual dispute point of view and done quite a bit of work in the electricity sector on privatization matters  He has done a couple

The Hindu An interesting article  Could it happen This article is emailed to you by tushar s dhruv  tushardhruvenroncom  Source The Hindu httpwwwhinduonnetcom Dabhol and the do nothing Government By Prem Shankar Jha Ever since the Vajpayees Government came to power more than two and a half years ago the economy has been sliding relentlessly into the deepest recession it has ever known In the nine months since December industrial growth has averaged 17 per cent The decade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months only five years ago when it touched 162 per cent are now but a distant memory Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11 terrorist strikes in the US It has now shrunk dramatically -vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TV sets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent With no demand to power it inflation measured by the consumer price index has fallen almost to zero The share market is dead and there is no fresh investment Employment in the organised sector is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human memory In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to find a place however humble in the organised sector of the economy but been turned away By 2004 the number will have risen by another three million But Mr Yashwant Sinha is confident that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of the countrys problems But one recent event highlights the governments paralysis more sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do This is its failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the Maharashtra State Electricity Boardss attempt to foil Enrons bid to take it before an international arbitration court by claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase agreement The London Court correctly maintained that just as a governments international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law proceedings in an international court must take precedence over those in a domestic court The way has therefore been cleared for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an international tribunal for a breach of it contractual obligations Given the fearsome proficiency of Enrons lawyers both those whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase agreement it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB will lose the case If that happens then by a conservative estimate India will have to pay around 5 billion in costs and damages In addition it will have to spend a little more to complete phase II of the project Thus in the end the project is likely to cost not 3 billion but more like 52 to 54 billion For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has dragged on the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was simply a dispute between a State Government and a private company and it had no say in the matter That pretext in any case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues But today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable let alone willing to pay such an enormous penalty So the bill will inevitably land at the Centres door And that means the taxpayers door The Centre will have no option but to pay But having done so will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government The answer obviously is no What it will be forced to do is transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete and operate But since no one can possibly run a 5 billion power plant generating 2100 MW of power profitably the NTPC too will insist on the capital value of the project being substantially written down first Judging from the offers that the Tata Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply Company BSES were making to Enron the written down value will not exceed 2 billion Thus whichever way we look at it the country will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant 3 billion without getting a single watt of electricity or for that matter anything else in return None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao government agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis Nor is it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning the latters inability under law to pay backup charges at more than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants would have been exposed long ago But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify even greater mistakes in the future For better or for worse the Enron deal was struck and it was struck not once but twice As a serious responsible government that knows the importance of honouring ones word in a world where contract is king the Vajpayee Government must honour the countrys contractual obligations This does not in any way preclude its trying to alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not see but by definition all future changes must be by mutual consent The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhols power affordable are known to all As the 1995 Renegotiating Committee and the Godbole Committee recommended the Government should buy the 800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a separate company that can supply gas to all the current and future users on the west coast In fact it could go one better and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage the plant This is entirely feasible because its installed capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need This will bring down the capital cost upon which backup charges and cost per unit of power will be calculated to 22 billion Second the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of the equity in Dabhol from the promoters This was negotiated with the 1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign exchange to 19 billion and the debt portion whose servicing represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to 12 billion The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee debt That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity tariffs to changes in the exchange rate With the price of oil having fallen for India to around 20 a barrel these changes will bring down the cost of Dabhols power at 90 per cent capacity utilisation own to below Rs 240 a unit This will make it entirely viable especially if Maharashtra and the neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and reduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be to take over the project from the MSEB renegotiate it with Enron or if Enron wants to opt out then buy the project from it at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before handing it over to the NTPC Getting dragged to court will neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhols power nor answer the more basic question - how can any electricity grid add new power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it charges for electricity

Heffron Kevin Hutchinson Mi chael Jones Timothy Lynch Drew Subject09EML Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Jeff  John We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals  Limited EML As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint Aft er your review we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss If you co ncur with the actions suggested please advise  If there is any balance sh eet debtorcreditor or cash forecast information that you require please  let us know Drew Lynch Kevin Heffron Jonathan Marsh and Joe Gold Introduction Enron Metals Limited  EML maintains a unique position within Enron Corp  EML is one of Enrons two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service s Authority FSA - the UK financial regulator and Enrons only remaining b rokerage business  Given its special status EML has responsibilities to i ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L ME metals exchange of which it is a member  As a result of this regulato ry oversight there are several differences between EML and Enrons other b usinesses 109EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato ry rules relating among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus iness Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers 209By virtue of its position as an LME broker there are certain circumst ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients  EMLs p olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible however EMLs cond uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship to exist  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th e FSA and the LME 309Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an d to protect against systemic risk EMLs position as a provider of liquidi ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME As a co nsequence of this concern the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain  prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi tion and credit risk The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA  regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem ent These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital which can be  used by way of regulatory capital and a breach of these rules is regarded  as extremely serious An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c ease carrying on business 409EMLs board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for a breach of the rules Penalties for individuals include significant fines and possible expulsion from the industry The duties owed by board members under the FSAs rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r elating to directors duties Directors Overriding Ring Fencing Obligation In the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem onstrate to the FSA that to the full extent possible the financial streng th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t he rest of Enron  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation  we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below Issues Surrounding Liquidity As we are all aware over the past week as a result of the reputation probl ems the corporation has been faced with we have substantially increased th e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML  This was a precautio n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML  Clearly the  goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing  of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t he non-EML related problems of Enron  This of course needed to be accompli shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was concerned 20 The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains and distributes its cash  In the event that cash is lent outside of EML it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap ital of the firm however the firm has a number of options to preserve its day to day liquidity20 20 In its position as an LME broker EML must have access to cash for two purp oses  First it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House  LCH  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater al to the LCH it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc ement action could ensue In addition it would be declared a defaulter and  the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions  Second it must be able to post margin to its clients  A failure to make a contractu al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre d to the FSA  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-money clients in the event that they wish to close their account  While th ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr ofits the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest ions Previously we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity However ce rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to  fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from the rest of Enron has become a concern  EML has or is in the process of l osing 60000000 of unsecured LCs which were primarily used in lieu of c ash at the LCH  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC s  Additionally a number of clients have requested that their accounts be transferred  Those transfers have reduced EMLs cash balance  Was the re maining 50 mm unsecured LC which has been issued by a single bank to be  withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid ity impact The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality  Therefore we have  agreed to start to do the following a09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t he rest of the enterprise b09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnel c09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints of continuing to do business on a normal basis d09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basis e09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidity f09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basis Operational Risk 20 In theory EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account s and rely on Enron Corp for the remaining portion of its day to day cash  needs  EMLs board have been resistant to this practice for several very p ractical reasons  First it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis  I f EML relied on Enron Corps daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs  it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp or an acco unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either capital or liquidity events as EMLs clearing account at Citibank would be substantially overdrawn  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi ght create a cascade for Enron EMLs board is reluctant to put that much f aith in the 100 accuracy of our operational safeguards Capital As noted above EML is subject to the FSAs regulatory capital rules and mu st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis  The FSA requires th at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110 of the minimum finan cial resources requirement  For a variety of reasons there were occasions when EML violated the 110 threshold on occasions in 2001 Because these v iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain s financial resources in excess of 120 so that it has a sufficient buffer  not to trigger the FSA notification requirement In the current climate the FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari se from Enrons perceived financial weakness Accordingly if one of those  violations occurred today the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM Ls cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily  basis EMLs board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev el of 130  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces s capital adequacy go hand in hand 20 Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress Testing The stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce narios which would cause liquidity issues for EML 109Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH 209Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH 309Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME  brokers 409Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly20 509Credit exposures leading to credit losses Recommendations The result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov erall operational liquidity 109To fully draw down the remaining 25 mm available under the  125 mm s ubordinated facility 209To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions 20 mm 309To increase the subordinated facility to 175 mm and extend the maturi ty by six months to July 2002 409To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi ts and other assets held by EML 509To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol d for calling margin 609To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients other th an a select group of key relationship clients20 709To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c ompanies EMCL and EMCC therefore shifting the need for inventory finance Current Situation Unsecured Guaranty09090965 mm Secured Guaranty09090915 mm Subordinated Loans090909107 mm EML Cash Balance09090959 mm Cash required to replace Withdrawn guaranty09090920mm EML Regulatory Capital Level09128 Excess Reg Capital over 1100930 mm Conclusion The attached financial analysis shows the result of the initial stress test ing The analysis shows certain low probability sets of circumstances where we w ould have liquidity issues  Given these possible eventualities we would ur ge that we move forward on points noted in bold above in addition to comple ting point f in the Issues Surrounding Liquidity Section

       the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work -        that I was making jobapplications by company email Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment As a manager Mr Bezanis has -        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval -        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance PRC process which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers and clients by review  Until now Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results -        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an energy index as a potential useful trading instrument  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite but the reaction of Mr Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first  I was banned by him from developing the idea further Discrimination It is our belief that Mr Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees especially competent women as equals  His rough stifling and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms Courtney Campbell the other only woman reporting to him Hostile Working Environment The working environment under Mr Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence  We are managed by threats rather than constructive comments Wrongful Termination Knowing I was unfairly treated Enron HR has not helped address my concerns  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process  Ms Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers no matter how wrong they are  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case Yours sincerely Mingcheng Lian

---------------------------rasheed mohammed mhrasheed2001yahoocom on 03202001 043224 PM To	jeffskillingenroncom cc Subject	URGENT RESPONSE REQUIRED Dear Friend I am Dr Rasheed Mohammed the newly appointed head of the Foreign Remittance Department in the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN I got your contact from a business directory of your country and based on your business activities and the type of investment I have in mind I found you to be the most suitable person for the transaction stated below Before I proceed I want to strongly advice that you devoid yourself from the general conception you have about Nigerians I would like you to carefully study this proposal without bias since it would be relevant in our lives It is a usual practice in Nigeria for ministers and high-ranking government officials to divert governments money into their private accounts this is usually done through CBN with the connivance of senior officials The ministers and military generals especially during the era of late general sani Abacha achieve this by diverting most of the funds meant for the development of their respective agencies and ministries into the CBN escrow accounts Usually it is this same escrow account that holds funds for the payment of foreign contracts  With the help of the inside officials the minister or senior government officials and military generals would now create themselves or employ the assistance of a foreign partner to create them as artificial contractors using fiticious documents to remit the deposited money to the nominated bank account of their foreign partners In this case the money is treated as payment for foreign contract and there is no trace This is how federal governments money is siphoned on a regular basis to the extent that most people now result to letter scams and fraud due to the knowledge they have about it Due to the impromptu removal of my successor from the central bank he did not have enough time to perfect and tidy up the transactions they have in place So the funds are now trapped at the central bank escrow account with no records I just discovered this in a bid to fulfill my obligation to submit the state of our escrow account to the federal government and the governor of CBN before I commence any foreign payment I am conducting a sort of reconciliation of our escrow account to declare to the government the total amount that have been spent in the last three years and what it was spent for So  in the course of carrying out the above exercise I discovered a total sum of 150MILLION in the escrow account that is unknown to anyone and with no records My intention is to reveal about USD 100M to the federal government so that I can be in his good books and make arrangement to transfer the outstanding USD 50M into a safe account abroad It is based on this that I am making this urgent contact with you However I am doing this because of the nature of my job I am a civil servant that is poorly paid and more so there is no way I can remain in this office forever I have children to cater for even when I retire as the director which is just next year So I need something tangible to fall back on when I retire Besides if I declare the total funds to the government it would probably go into the pockets of a few people that control the government This is to enlighten you on the degree of corruption in Nigeria So do not blame me for my action because you would do the same if you were in my shoes knowing fully well that there will be no compensation even if you disclose everything to the government Well I have discovered that I can transfer this money if we could quickly create you as an artificial contractor by using your company document and Bank account to receive the money in the same way my successor transferred theirs The only difference is that the final payment is going to be made to your named company through any of our correspondent payment center in Europe or America due to the policies adopted by the new democratic government The entire process is not easy but it is achievable due to my position in the foreign remittance department of the CBN and the relationship I have with the present director of external payment and finance of the federal ministry of finance The entire operation will be between the three of us I I shall take care of all documentation ii My friend in the federal ministry of finance will take care of all lobbying and use of influence to get all documentation iii You shall take care of the banking arrangements provide the needed invoices to enable us apply for claims and approvals and travel as the beneficiary to receive the funds from the payment center you shall be paid from After we have succeeded in transferring this funds 20 shall be retained by you for your assistance 5 for the settlement of all debts we might incur in the course of this transaction and the remaining 75 shall be for me and my colleague which we would possibly invest in into your company or any viable business venture you suggest If you are comfortable with this programme please revert to me at once via telephone number 234-1-7593507 or fax number 234-1-7590440 Should your response be positive I would then instruct on the next step to take Due to security reasons when you call do not ask for any name simply ask me to reconfirm the telephone number Once I reconfirm my number to be 234-1-7593507 you can then mention my name before you go into any discussion If I fail to reply correctly do not wait for a second trial just drop the phone and call back later We demand a quick response from you Any delay might result in contacting someone else Irrespective of what happens we count on your maturity to keep the transaction to yourself So you are advised to treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality Looking forward to your urgent response Yours faithfully Dr Rasheed Mohammed Do You Yahoo Get email at your own domain with Yahoo Mail

Steven Subject	Re PEER GROUP MAPPING Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly within a four peer group structure  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Govt public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Govtpublic  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities net income these individuals should be moved to specialized technicaland others who are performing a less strategic function who should remain in the commercial support category With that said it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt If we stay with the four group stucture I intend to push hard for the remapping of Govt Affairs by year-end On a completely seperate issue I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the preferred distribution  relative to the bottom category for  commercial support groupsIm not implying this isnt an issue for commercial groups- I just dont have the same ability to assess the impact therethe concern simply stated  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a preferred distribution are quite highand that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour Thanks Enron Energy Services  From  David W Delainey  EES                           05102001 1026 AM Sent by	Kay ChapmanEES To	David

GROUP MAPPING Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3 It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups All functionsactivities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached The actions points from this excercise are 1	to review and agree the attached mapping 2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment 3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25 To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VPMD PRC Meetings  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
