jlsfullenweidercomENRON Sent	Tuesday October 23 2001 940 AM To	Stepenovitch Joe Cc	Donn Fullenweider Subject	RE Stepenovitch Dear Joe In order to prepare your case for trial several things are necessary as follows 1  Depositions must be taken of you and Tonya 2  We must send discovery to Tonya and we must have sufficient time pursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for it to be answered prior to trial 3  The Court will require mediation before we can go to trial 4 The Court will appoint a mental health examiner and possible an attorney ad litem to represent Paytons best interests This is now a case where custody and possession are an issue and these steps MUST be taken before we can proceed to trial  Initially after paternity was established and you first visited with Payton your desire was that all possession periods would be worked out by agreement and neither you nor Tonya wanted any more court proceedings  However since then Tonya has bucked your every request for visitation and put limitations of one kind or another on it turning the case into a custody case  Without discovery to Tonya similar to the discovery we answered for you and Tonyas deposition and a mental health evaluation we are not prepared for trial and the Court would not be ready to hear the case and entertain what was in Paytons best interest  Therefore Mr Fullenweider did not opposed Stewart Gagnons motion for continuance and would have in fact have filed one himself in keeping with your best interest and Paytons in mind As I explained we are working on a Request for Temporary Orders which I expect will be set on 111401 along with the hearing on mental evaluations  At that time I expect the court to set your possession periods with Payton including holidays  Until then we must work on scheduling your possession periods by agreement To confirm your November 3rd visitation period you have chosen to have Payton from 1200 noon to 700 pm in Vero Beach on the 3rd and will forego November 4th Where will you pick up and drop off Payton Jonda -----Original Message-----From JoeStepenovitchenroncom mailtoJoeStepenovitchenroncom Sent Tuesday October 23 2001 905 AM To jlsfullenweidercom Subject RE Stepenovitch Good Morning Jonda I received the papers from you yesterday about the continuance  I was under the impression that it was the court moving the date  It looks like to me its Tonya and her Lawyer  They have been doing pushing this case back from the start and Im sure they are doing this for a reason to say to the jury that a bond has been created and its not in the best interest of the child to go with his father after being with his mother for so long At this point if we go to trial Payton will be 1 year old and I will have only seen him about 12 times  I dont think I will win that battle As for the November 12th court date will we have something in writing by the judge so I can start having my rights  I feel like her and her lawyer can tell us what to do and we must follow there rules  Will this change or do I have to go through this until the April court date  That cant be how is system works  I should have the right to pick my own son up whenever I want and no court or lawyer or even his mother should have anything to say about that  I dont understand why everything is against me Finally  for the weekend of Nov 1st I will take my son

jlsfullenweidercomENRON Sent	Tuesday October 23 2001 940 AM To	Stepenovitch Joe Cc	Donn Fullenweider Subject	RE Stepenovitch Dear Joe In order to prepare your case for trial several things are necessary as follows 1  Depositions must be taken of you and Tonya 2  We must send discovery to Tonya and we must have sufficient time pursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure for it to be answered prior to trial 3  The Court will require mediation before we can go to trial 4 The Court will appoint a mental health examiner and possible an attorney ad litem to represent Paytons best interests This is now a case where custody and possession are an issue and these steps MUST be taken before we can proceed to trial  Initially after paternity was established and you first visited with Payton your desire was that all possession periods would be worked out by agreement and neither you nor Tonya wanted any more court proceedings  However since then Tonya has bucked your every request for visitation and put limitations of one kind or another on it turning the case into a custody case  Without discovery to Tonya similar to the discovery we answered for you and Tonyas deposition and a mental health evaluation we are not prepared for trial and the Court would not be ready to hear the case and entertain what was in Paytons best interest  Therefore Mr Fullenweider did not opposed Stewart Gagnons motion for continuance and would have in fact have filed one himself in keeping with your best interest and Paytons in mind As I explained we are working on a Request for Temporary Orders which I expect will be set on 111401 along with the hearing on mental evaluations  At that time I expect the court to set your possession periods with Payton including holidays  Until then we must work on scheduling your possession periods by agreement To confirm your November 3rd visitation period you have chosen to have Payton from 1200 noon to 700 pm in Vero Beach on the 3rd and will forego November 4th Where will you pick up and drop off Payton Jonda -----Original Message-----From JoeStepenovitchenroncom mailtoJoeStepenovitchenroncom Sent Tuesday October 23 2001 905 AM To jlsfullenweidercom Subject RE Stepenovitch Good Morning Jonda I received the papers from you yesterday about the continuance  I was under the impression that it was the court moving the date  It looks like to me its Tonya and her Lawyer  They have been doing pushing this case back from the start and Im sure they are doing this for a reason to say to the jury that a bond has been created and its not in the best interest of the child to go with his father after being with his mother for so long At this point if we go to trial Payton will be 1 year old and I will have only seen him about 12 times  I dont think I will win that battle As for the November 12th court date will we have something in writing by the judge so I can start having my rights  I feel like her and her lawyer can tell us what to do and we must follow there rules  Will this change or do I have to go through this until the April court date  That cant be how is system works  I should have the right to pick my own son up whenever I want and no court or lawyer or even his mother should have anything to say about that  I dont understand why everything is against me Finally  for the weekend of Nov 1st I will take my son
