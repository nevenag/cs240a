In the past we have blessed RAC as a truly corporate function with whom we could share information and receive services.  When I read that there are power trading folks on the RAC team, my radar goes up about the need to put firewalls in place within RAC.

Subject:	New Legal Team to Assist RAC

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Shelley, I was going to call you regarding this Partial Day Recall NOPR.  I=
 spoke with Anna Cochrane today, and she said that in terms of INGAA's plan=
s for answering the NOPR, the GISB pipeline group already has mobilized to =
work on INGAA positions (the GISB folks got together on their own, accordin=
g to Anna).  Since this is a GISB issue, can I assume you are in this loop?=
  Also, for Enron we should discuss how to develop comments, between your f=
olks and Joe's group.

Thanks,
Nancy

Ricki - would you please:

1. Make reservations at 11:45 on Thurs for Judy Johnson & I at Duck & Co in Hyatt

2. Set up a pre-meeting for Don Hawkins & I before our meeting with Rod tomorrow

3. Move my Wed. staff meeting to run from 10-11:30 (instead of 9-10).  Since we no longer have a Wash office, I plan to watch the Commission meeting myself

Suzanne,
 
Next time you talk to Liz Gras would you pass along my phone number and email.  I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans.
 
I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together for court dates/travel.  One of the other Houston families (Swangos) has made progress on their dossier and turned in their INS approval.  The other (the Westbrooks) haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier.  I want to be very supportive and accomodate all the families -- after all the goal line is home for all these children.  At the same time, I need to form realistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family.  I think talking to Liz will be helpful on this front.
 
Thanks for all your help.  After you make the homestudy changes noted below you will resend to Gwyn?  Then she'll send to me to send to INS?  Probably sometime next week?
 
I'm planning to take a vacation day tomorrow -- and the type A person that I am, I'm just afraid that I'll miss some important action that I should be taking.  You can reach me on my cell at 713-857-2103 if you need to reach me tomorrow.

Shelley,
 
We will need to change the address and then get it all signed again.  It is good to know that the study overall meets their requirements.  This is probably going to take a few more days.  Still, it is better to have all of this taken care of now than to have someone send the study back.
 
Sorry for the delay.

Dear Suzanne, 
I reviewed the homestudy you emailed to Ginger and it looks good.Please 
change the address for Across the World to :399 Taylor Boulevard,Suite 
102, 
Pleasant Hill, California 94523.That is the address for the main office in 
Calif. I did notice that MARITAL was spelled marial in the marital 
section. 
I'm sure your spellcheck probably caught it.I noticed that you mentioned 
the" Republic of Kazakhstan" quite a few times. I'm not sure if that is 
the 
correct name of the country. I will check and let you know if you need to 
change it.There is only one other thing that needs to be changed .It is 
located about the last paragraph of recommendation where you state that 
"the 
family is excited to experience the Russian culture".That statement would 
be 
very offensive to the Kazakhstan officials if you were to mention Russian 
culture. These people are not part of Russia-they are Kazakhstani- and a 
very proud people.So you could just change the word Russian to Kazakhstan. 
They do not like to be referred to as Russian.Let me know if you have any 
questions. I left you a message to call me but I don't think you need to 
call back unless you have questions. Please make sure that there is a 
current agency license at the back of the homestudy when the family sends 
their homestudy to me. I will be the one helping Ginger go thru everything 
so if you have questions feel free to call Ginger or me. 
Chris

I know that we are all under a lot of stress and I probably shouldn't send this note, but I just have to get this off my chest.  Have I done something to undermine your faith in me?  

- When I worked on due diligence matters, you asked me why was I working on due diligence
- When I prepared the demand letters you asked me why I was sending the demand letters
- And, today, despite the fact that we oversee the  day to day transactions, there is no mention of my group in the customer letter.

I wish someone would just fire me if I'm incompetent, because I live in a hell worse than being fired -- at least I'd have time for my family.

Gary,

Except for this week, it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 42C1 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control.

A couple of thoughts

-  Per travelocity Lufthansa does fly between Houston-Frankfurt-Alma Ata & then Moscow-Frankfurt-IAH.  We'd only have to take
Transaero one way from Alma ata to Moscow.

- If we fly through Moscow on way to Kaz, keep in mind that the airport we fly into Moscow will be a totally different airport than the airport we fly from Moscow to Kaz (the regional airport).  I have heard that the regional airport is not a very safe or American friendly place.

- I want to me flexible on travel.  But, I'd really, really rather not fly on Aeroflot.

Thanks for you voice message.  I have been traveling the last couple days and thought Tim forwarded the memo & invoice on Monday.  In reality, he was on a trip with some Gulf South folks & just returned to the office today.   He sent the attached memo and invoice this morning.  I was a bit off with my timing -- as September accounting close is tomorrow.  Thanks again for your help in resolving this matter.

Kevin,
We can get ETS-related pipe throughput for 2001 (and Rick has subsequently sent the TW 2001 data).  But we won't have non Enron pipeline throughput until they publish.

I'm confused - I thought we had throughput data on a more timely manner? Is it the specific format that is the problem or the data itself? If we want to estimate it, that would be fine also.

Unfortunately, I can only (immediately) help by providing throughput data for the Enron pipelines that was recently provided for another data request that covered the period 1996 - 2000.   It is attached below and has a tab for Transwestern.  The 2001 FERC Form 2 delivery data is not yet available since the Form 2 will not be completed until April 30, 2002.  Please let me know if you have difficulty finding the data elsewhere and I will ask the TW marketing or regulatory groups if they have any contacts.

Liz,

I'm not sure if we met either time at the Austin airport this summer.  My husband and I hosted 4-year old Alina, part of the same Taraz group as your child.   We miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home.  We're certainly not looking forward to travel at this time, and even less happy about leaving our 6-year old son home while we are out of country, but we are resolved to bring Alina home -- the sooner, the better.

Based on conversations with Ginger and Chris, it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time -- although I'm not sure when.

We have completed our dossier (although I haven't sent the originals to Ginger); completed our home study & sent into INS recently; and we've already done the INS fingerprinting.  So I guess the next steps are INS approval, shipping stuff off to Kazakstan, and getting our Kazakstan visas.

One of the hardest parts of the Kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return.  She is in the Ulan orphanage in Taraz.  Alina speaks only Kazak, no Russian, so I'm not sure how I'd communicate with her long distance even if I had an address or phone number.  Fortunately I have received periodic emails from Larissa, the escort that came to Houston with the children this summer.  Her husband, Sergei, has been to visit the children in Taraz & she sent me a picture of Alina.

Sorry to ramble so.  I'm anxious to talk to you about your child, your travel plans, possibilities for hiring an escort, etc.  Please feel free to call or email me anytime.  Here is my contact info.

Still working...for today anyway. We spent a cold weekend in Conroe TX.  Alina was well-behaved all weekend.  

Can you do lunch this week?  Perhaps tomorrow?

SHelley: I feel AWFULLLL!!! What can I do? YOu are just about the best friend I have ever had in my whole life and I feel like I am absolutely falling short on supporting you right now. I am sorry about the wallet snatching - that is incredible --- How in the world could those charges  have occurred so quickly since it is the holidays, I would think that the cashiers are being extra careful. Anyway... I am glad that you are going on the trip; My mom and dad said that they are going to pray for you every day (they go to Mass now everyday at St. Joseph's Villa in Philly) - same with my sisters -- they have all been asking about you. Lunch really was great and was definitely needed by me! I am also sure by now you have heard the news about Cuba --- I am so sad about his passing - my understanding was that the chemo was working on his cancer (which had recurred from last year) but when he was supposed to be discharged, he came ! down with pneumonia and died shortly after. 

I will keep in touch with you via email and if there is ANYTHING I can do --- even wiring funds if you need it while you are travelling, let me know... 

Take care, 

Rosemary

Upon further review with Frank regarding the alternate point usage on contract 23844 for the months of November '00, December '00, January '01, February '01 and March '01, it was determined there wasn't a violation.  MidAmerican is allowed 50,000 MMBtu/day delivered to alternate delivery points in association with contract 23844.  This information was overlooked at the time and since has been evaluated.  Please make the necessary corrections so that it is reflected that MEC did not have any alternate point use charges for those months .  If you need additional documentation, please let me know.
Thanks,

Pam,

Thanks for all your help on the move/relocation.  I think you, Donna Scott & Jean McFarland have made the process of moving very efficient for all involved.  

On the longer range issue; however, I need to elevate my level of concern that the moves are having on customer service issues.  Since Tropical Storm Allison, ETS has experienced one computer system outage after another; including the virus problem the week before last.  This morning our scheduling system is out and we are having Internet problems -- both of which are impacting customer nominations.  During system outages it is imperative that gas logistics be able to mobilize and implement back-up plans to ensure customer transactions.  This is best handled by having a central staging area.

I realize these system reliablity problems have nothing to do with our moves or with the ultimate location of the Gas Logistics group.  Certainly I am pursuing these reliability concerns with Steve Hotte.  But, in light of these issues, I would like to talk about the timing & end state of where Gas Logistics is to be located and how long it is going to take to make this happen.   I know that your first priority of late has been to get us off 41.  Now that that has happened, I'd like to talk about the timing for which floor remodeling comes next (39, 42, etc) and the ramifications for my group.

I have heard back from Danny and he wants us to cancel the event.  Get whatever money back you can & see if we can forgo  any other current payments by postponing the event until next year, rather than canceling.

Subject:	RE: Final Review of FERC California Reporting - August 2001
Importance:	High

Mary Kay asked me to relay the following comments.  Elizabeth suggested I put them in an E-mail so that the Houston group could discuss sat 3:30.

1.  Item #1 PDT record (roughly page 109)
On TI contract #26849 for 8/18/2001-8/20/2001, report shows scheduled & delivered  volume of 1068 with NO nominated volume.
Elizabeth suspects that this was manually scheduled overrun.  
If that is the case, Mary Kay recommends that you make the Nominated column match the volume in the Scheduled column.

2.  Item #3 Footnote #3
Mary Kay suggested the following wording.  Do you agree that this describes what happened?
She is assuming that this was still related to the Force Majeur with Gallup being down, since Operating Capacity went down
from 8/19 to 8/20 then back up on 8/21.

"After operating for a day under the Force Majeure, physical mainline capacity was adjusted based on operating conditions."


- Rita

Alina's Dr. appt is at 10 in the medical center.  We'll have to have her go first at the dentist in case the dentist appointment runs long?

I was planning pasta for dinner.  I am not going to the Bunco game until 7 PM.

Chad should be in a really good mood -- since I put the treasure map in his lunch to find his post Stanford 9 Test present (Battletops) when he gets home.

Hi Cyndi,

Chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for
dinner pretty much anytime.  I know you are trying to tie up loose ends
at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight.   How
does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound? 

 Kim, can you pick up Chad and meet me there?  Gaby says she may take
Chad to Lucas later this afternoon.  Please pay Gaby if you see her --
as I have given her the day off tomorrow.

Schedulers talking points on the separation of NNG/ENA


 

1.  NNG and ENA are entirely separate entities and our businesses are run entirely separate from one another.

2.  Customers may think that they can net ENA invoices against NNG invoices.  NNG is a separate business and is not responsible for ENA invoices to their customers.

3.  Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly.

4.  Creditworthiness status for ENA remains the responsibility of the Commercial Department. We are to maintain our normal course of business until instructed otherwise.

A couple of thoughts on the SoCalGas Complaint

1.  Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake -- not a billing mistake.  The point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlement and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.  The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.  

2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).

3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.  FERC let them re-bill customers for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.  I think this is a 2000 case.

One of my goals as ETS General Counsel is to assure that the group is organ=
ized in a way that allows all of us to provide quality services to our clie=
nts in the most efficient manner possible.  One of the ways to do this is t=
o modify our internal organization to better track the "functionalized" org=
anization that ETS has recently adopted in the operations and commercial ar=
eas.  Additionally, we must continually revisit the way we allocate our res=
ources to reflect client priorities.  Accordingly, I am pleased to announce=
 that Colleen Raker will begin reporting directly to me, effective immediat=
ely.  Richard Melton, Lee Huber and Kim Wilkie will report to Colleen.  Col=
leen's team will have primary responsibility for serving the "new business =
generation" efforts within Steve Hotte's IT group and Phil Lowry's Operatio=
ns group.  Additionally, Colleen's team will focus on asset purchase and sa=
le transactions and financings, while Colleen and Richard will take lead re=
sponsibility on pipeline security efforts led by Mike Nelson's team.  Each =
of these lawyers will also continue serving the numerous other clients they=
 assisted before this organizational change.

Lou Soldano's group will continue its emphasis on serving the needs of the =
rest of Phil Lowry's organization, including the key area of right of way a=
cquisition and other legal requirements related to pipeline expansions.  Gr=
eg Porter's group will continue its focus on   commercial and regulatory ac=
tivity on the NNG and TW systems.  Greg's group gets reinforcements on Mond=
ay, as Bill Rapp is joining us from EES.  Bill will focus on TW matters, an=
d will coordinate closely with Tony Pryor, Maria Pavlou, and Greg and Dot a=
s he gets up to speed on the busy TW docket.  Dot McCoppin's group will con=
tinue its role supporting all commercial and regulatory activity for Citrus=
/FGT.  Dot's group will also assist with TW matters as appropriate.

Given the dynamic business we are a part of and the small size of our group=
, the organizational structure outlined above is intended to be very flexib=
le.  Each of us will continue to be called on by clients to assist with pro=
jects that don't fit neatly into the above structure.  That is part of the =
challenge we face, but also part of the fun we enjoy! =20

Please join me in congratulating Colleen on her new responsibilities and in=
 welcoming Bill to the group on Monday! =20

Here's what I'd like to do on this--we'll just take out the word
"interactive" in describing the open season we're proposing to use for
operational capacity.  I think Staff will come back and ask for an
interactive process, but we can address that issue when and if we get to
the next step.  Again, this initial offer is mostly designed to simply
get the process rolling and to flush Staff out on whether they are
serious or not.  We won't start putting meaning into the very broad
concepts in the outline unless Staff comes back with a serious interest
in settling.  Thanks.  df

Subject: RE: Restated 2002 CAPEX Plan


Don,
 
I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.
 
With respect to the specific project listed:
 
1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.
 
 
With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:
 
2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.
 
3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.  
 
 
An additional footnote should be added to the page.
 
4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.

Attached for your review and information is a copy of the Restated 2002 Capital Budget (25 page report) which reflects the planned CAPEX recently agreed to between NNG/Dynegy and Enron.

Rick,

When I was approving latest expense report I noticed an item listed Gulfstream project (lunch with Keith Higginbotham).  I have been working on Gulfstream OBA & interconnect agreement with Frazier/Dot/ Sharon for several weeks.  I didn't realize that you were working on Gulfstream items too.   What is your team working on on Gulfstream?

Also can I get a copy of the revised contract quick reference manual.  I think I had the outdated  one prior to the latest printing.

Thanks

Shelley

Ginger/Chris,

The Orphans petitions coordinator at the Houston INS office called this morning to say that our paperwork appeared in order and that she has an appointment to review our case with her supervisor this afternoon.  She said that we should receive the approval notification form within a week.

I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.  Tim - are these numbers verified and up to date.  Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.   It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.  

If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.

Subject: Question About Flat Stanley Project



Hi Ms. Traylor,

I gave my mom a heads up that "flat Stanley" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like
recent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological
terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's
email.

Hope all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school.  At first he expected to be 
coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month.
Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.

I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what Chad needs to develop.

While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted
a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look
like Alina and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.

Regards,

Shelley Corman  (Chad's Mom)

Hi Shel,

Did you say that "Flat Stanley" will arrive in a white envelope?  I received 
a yellow envelope in the mail today with no return address, my name & address 
were typed and it had a "non-profit" stamp on it.  I did not open it.  It's 
in the trash can but the garbage man doesn't go 'til Thursday... I can 
retrieve it if you think it might be the envelope from Chad.

Love,
Mom

Upon repressurizing the Station 13 yard piping it was discovered that the new side valve installed has a leak.  We have instructed the team to go ahead and try to resolve/fix this problem now.  The market continues to underburn and we will have no problems today making all deliveries while they continue to work at station 13.

The bad news is that if they can not resolve this valve problem today, then there is a strong possibility that we will have to do this outage again.

Gary Smith asked me to come by his office before noon.  I am in gas control now -- I stopped by your office with Connor.

The Phase V team has completed their work at Station 13.  Currently the operations crew at Station 13 is purging and packing the 30" mainline at Station 13 to the first valve section.  They are about one hour from completion.  We will return our mailine valves and horsepower to normal operating status when they are done.

The market only took a 1375 on the 1550 schedule; thus, we were able to keep the market well packed up, and we are in great position for making all deliveries again today.

FP&L only took 700 yesterday and they only want to target 720 today.  They have 783 scheduled today.  They had orginally nominated 850+ with the anticipation that they might lose some gas this weekend.  I think they are happy so far this weekend with our flexibility afforded to them.

I will email you when the line is completely turned back to us at Station 13.

If you are church, please do not respond to this email -- I would not want responisiblity for causing you to stumble into 
the sin of not listening to the sermon.

We will continue to schedule transactions with ENA and other Enron affiliates in a business as normal fashion.  If ENA's supply is cut, then deliveries will be adjusted, just as we normally do.  

Bob Superty, Dir of ENA Gas Logistics has asked to be notified of any ENA supply cuts.  I'm not talking about nits and nats that are part of the normal confirmation process, rather, I'm talking about if a confirming party refuses to confirm a block of ENA gas.     We are notifying Bob as a courtesy and nothing about this added notice should hold up routine business processes.

You can leave Bob a voice message at x 3-0957 or call me and I'll call Bob.  In any event, I also would like to be briefed about any significant cuts in ENA or other Enron affiliate supply.

Thanks.  No-Notice Imbalances are market area from the perspective of commodity pricing.  The only reason that they are separated out from the rest of the imbalances is because of the transportation element of the cash-out price.

Did ETS officially make a bid to the bankruptcy court for abandoned equipment?  Any computers or just flat screens?

    Shelley,

         I was shut-out of the click-at-home program before I got a P.C. ordered and was wondering what the status, is on some of the surplus
computer equipment that is still in the building. I am guessing that there is some left of the same quality or better, than that offered in the
program. Maybe you could start a after Chrismas gift sale. Because it was my idea you could give me mine for free  Ha!

                                                                                                                                                   Thanks Ron Spain

Galen/Jim,

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.


A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?

Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.


Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.

Hope you are doing well.
 
Any update on when Gwyn will sign and forward the homestudy?  I was hoping that I might be in a position to forward to the INS later this week.   I have all completed the rest of my dossier and am now focused on INS approval.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron?s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron?s Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron?s stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron?s remaining management team to direct the company?s ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world?s most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Dear Mr. _____________,
 
By prior correspondence dated ______, we notified you that we  you were notified of Ashford United Methodist Church's concern over the proEarlier this year AMaintenance of Houston currently provides janitorial service to Ashford United Methodist Church and Ashford Child Enrichment Center under a month to month contract.   Under this arrangement, Maintenance of Houston provides an on-site janitor.
 
In our initial correspondence soliciting janitorial service bids, we explained that our facility is used as a school during the week.  We explained the importance from a security perspective of minimizing the number of different people that have access to the facility.  We also asked Maintenance of Houston to provide documentation of employee screening procedures.
 
It has recently come to our attention that Maintenance of Houston has not furnished employee screening documentation for the individual that Maintenance of Houston currently has assigned to our facility.  It is our policy to request criminal background information for any contractor that is in our facility during school hours.
 
Please furnish such employee screening information to us by April 30, 2001.  To the extent Maintenance of Houston is unable to provide documentation for the current individual assigned to our facility or furnish another individual that does have appropriate documentation by April 30, 2001, we are hereby providing notice of our intent to terminate the month to month agreement effective May 31, 2001.
 
 
 
 
Sincerely

I'm not sure if you are the person I need to be contacting, so if you're not 
maybe you can lead me in the right direction.

I am in the process of working on a gas well in Hodgeman County, Kansas;
Section 18, T21S, R22W.  The BTU test for a well in the vicinity came back 
at 723BTU.  699.25 Methane, 14.64 Ethane, 4.77 Propane, 1.3 Isobutane, 0.98 
Normal Butane, 0.4 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 1.51 Hexanes.  Mole % is 
69.45 Methane, 0.83 Ethane, 0.19 Propane, 0.04 Isobutane, 0.03 Normal 
Butane, 0.01 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 0.03 Hexanes, 28.45 Nitrogen, 
0.04 Oxygen, 0 Carbon Dioxide, 0.93 Helium, and 0 Hydrogen.

Do you have a pipeline in the vicinity, and would you be able to purchase or 
transport the forementioned quality of gas.

If you could inform me on pipelines who could service this well please send 
me an e-mail.

Thank you.

Just got off the phone with the hotel.  If we postpone the event the cancellation fee still applies and fee cannot be used toward future events.  The cancellation fee consists of anticipated revenue, however, the hotel has agreed to gives us a 20% discount.

Anticipated Revenue:
		 Food:		$1,055.00
		 Drinks:	   $800.00
				$1,855.00

$1,855.00 with 20% Off =  $1,484.00
				 296.80   (20% service charge)
			          	 146.92   (8.25% Sales Tax)
                           $1,927.72

If all of marketing is in agreement and we can demonstrate the elements sufficently to include in the filing.  How will this work in the field area??  Doesn't this conceptually give everyone the same priority or we narrowing it down to within the MID?  MK

In our meetings today on Order No. 637, we failed to discuss the topic of alternate point priorities "within-the-path". Marketing indicated in a meeting yesterday that they would like a change to alternate rights in the Market Area.  That change would provide that use of an alternate point within the operational zone where the shipper's primary rights are located would have priority over alternate rights in an operational zone where the shipper doesn't have primary.  This means we would have another level of alternate to be added to the tariff.  For example, if Minnegasco made an alternate nomination in Zone D at E.Dubuque, they would have a lower alternate right than Wisconsin Gas at E.Dubuque.
 
Please provide any comments you have on this issue along with your other comments requested to be provided to Maria by COB on Monday.  
 
p.s. I recognize this would fall into the category of "needing system changes so it may take awhile".

Jeffri,

I have received the revised W-2 forms from Enron that increases my reported income to reflect my non-eligibility to participate in the dependent daycare spending accounts.  (See letter in the package of information that I previously delivered to you).  Evidently Enron failed the test for providing dependent day care benefits to highly compensated employees.  I will fedex the revised W-2 forms to you.

I would like to set up a date (perhaps over the lunch hour one day) to meet at your office to review my return and to discuss alternatives for the second home (either rental or sale to my mother and/or her fianc?).

Good morning all.

Attached is the info that Esther helped me pull together for Rod last Wednesday. Rod told me over the weekend that he needs commodity volumes for these contracts for the years 1997-2000.  Help?  Can someone pull this together quickly for me?

Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.

Kevin/Rod - One line item on the TW counterparty revenue summary probably requires explanation.  The report shows a net $4.2 million payment to PG&E for transportation.  This is because PG&E released capacity at rates in excess of the maximum rate due TW -- thus PG&E was due a credit.  This was not a liability to TW, as the other side of this capacity release is embedded in the revenues paid to TW by other counterparties.

I thought that you would enjoy reading this article about Chad's school.  My editorial notes are added in red.  Keeping watching www.houstonisd.org/bushes for when they post pictures of the event.

AWESOME VISIT
On Friday, October 19, President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush visited our school. The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of Afghanistan. Right in front of the entire student body, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $1, 147.00! The children were very impressed!
The day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our children were stellar! The program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school. Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement!
As the President and Mrs. Bush entered the stage, the children waved paper dollars in the air to greet them. The program opened with the singing of the school song. Carmen Sullivan gave a history of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and Kelly Iko (this is our Kelly from Sunday School -- whom I'm sure will be the first minority President of the United States)  led the group in the Pledge. The students sang God Bless America and waved individual flags. Not an eye was dry! It was awesome.
Maggie Strange, Julius Liu, Danny Siso and Brandi Shallenberger told the group about the effort the Bush students had put forth to collect money for the Afghan children. Doris Reese, Joan Zhang (this is a sweet little girl from Chad's class) , and Andrew Nelson wheeled in a red wagon with the students' contribution! The program closed with more flag waving and the singing of It's a Small World.

I copied the children's church materials yesterday and will have Gaby drop them off at church tomorrow.

We agreed to have a children's church meeting tacked on to the end of the next children's ministry meeting.

Would you please check to see that VBS is penciled in July 22-26 on the church calendar.

Thank you

Hi, Ms. Corman.

This is Mrs. Jung.  This is my email if you ever need it for future
reference.  :)

Flat Stanley was sent in the envelopes provided from home.  I had the kids
put labels with the school's address on it in the return address corner.  I
also included an envelope with the school's address on it so that Stanleys
could be returned.  I'm glad to hear Stanleys are being anticipated.  I know
the kids are really excited about them.

I'm also glad to hear Chad's enjoying school.  We are definitely doing
harder work than Kindergarten.  We're actually doing different work than the
rest of first grade - more challenging, mind-stretching work, I'd like to
believe.

I was very encouraged by your letter and just wanted to express my
appreciation for sharing your thoughts with us.  Thanks again!  Let me know
if you have any other questions.


Sincerely,
Mrs. Jung

Fantastic.  Is Sheila planning to attend?  If so then, there are already 8 tickets committed.  If any of these cancel, I have a back-up list.

I will take 2 seats.  Please give me the invites for those two.  I'll take care of their transport.  They will not need Enron transport.

Subject:	Greetings from Houston, TX

Catherine,

Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would be emailing you.   

This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.  

We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.

We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.

Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.  

In His Name,

Shelley Corman

Hi Shelley:
Perhaps we can talk tonight about several things I need to coordinate with 
you.
(1)  Children's Church schedule for December.  I talked to Steve Hoyle, and 
he did not have a preference one way or the other about Children's Church for 
the Cantata Sunday.  He did say the music program was rather long, with lots 
of dialogue.  I am inclined to say let's have C/C, and I can commit to being 
there.  Of course, we need at least 2 others to commit as well.  Since it 
would be rather long, I would be in favor of supplementing the C/C service 
with a Christmas-themed video.
(2)  Have you looked into food from McDonald's for the Christmas party?  I am 
working on the invite's, and tentatively am putting down on the RSVP card a 
meal preference of hamburgers or chicken nuggets (check one.)   That way, we 
can go either way with Happy Meals or just the basic food and fries, 
depending on cost, ease of packaging, etc.  Let me know what you think and if 
you need help with looking into this.
(3)  I saw some cute "Happy Birthday, Jesus" themed trinkets in the Oriental 
Trading catalog.  If you think we need more things for the treat bags, this 
is a possibility.  They also had a cute plastic treat bag with this theme 
that was fairly inexpensive.  (I can't remember if you said you already had 
bags or were still going to get them.)
I could talk tonight after 9:00, if that is convenient for you.
Thanks, Shelley!

I am feeling pretty blue today with all the Enron stuff.  Finances being what they are -- we need to do some serious soul searching on Royal Oaks.  Can we get our money back if we walk or are we stuck.  Please also calculate the value of your Transocean options.  I may want to monetize these to cover adoption/travel expenses.

Thank you for your hard work and your continued commitment to the March of Dimes. 

Enron's 2001 WalkAmerica campaign was the #14 Walk Team in Houston, contributing $72,563 to the March of Dimes. In addition, Danny McCarty was the #2 fundraiser in the city, raising $20,350, and Sophie Patel was the #5 fundraiser, raising $10,002.

In appreciation of all your efforts for WalkAmerica and the March of Dimes, you and a guest are invited to the 2001 March of Dimes' WineFest on Thursday, October 4 from 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. at the Crystal Ballroom of the Rice Hotel. It will be a great evening of food, wine, friends, and a silent auction.

Please let me know by Friday, September 28, if you will be able to attend WineFest 2001.

Thank you, again, and hope to see you there.

I know you were being nice and I am sorry.

I really can't put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now.  It takes me 1/2 hour to get myself together.  

I shouldn't have been so mean to you.  I know you were being nice.  I know this isn't a reasonable request, but these aren't reasonable times -- I just need some space when I'm getting ready in the morning.  

The heat and the fact that I couldn't have coffee this morning just put me over the edge.

My physical was ok.  Listen to this, because they are a preventive medicine shop he can't prescribe antibiotics.  So then, I couldn't get my travel vaccines, until I find out whether I have a sinus infection and need to be on antibiotics. 

Am I just dreaming these last few months or is this really my life?

Q,

I'm sorry about this morning.  I really was trying to be nice by making some
coffee and turning up the heat so it would be easier for you to get out of
bed.  How was your physical?  Did they give you an antibiotic?  Let me know.

Tonya,

Haven't heard from you in awhile and I am assuming that you were probably just burnt out over the flurry of summer activity.  All of my paperwork (including INS approval) is turned into Ginger and I am now just anxiously awaiting the opportunity to travel to Kazakhstan.  Ginger and crew are so busy that I imagine that things won't happen very fast.  

Not try to bother you if you had enough of this Kidsave stuff -- but on the other hand --- you worked hard to bring the kids here this summer and I just wanted to let you in on the fruits of your efforts.

Shelley

We had 22 kids and 3 adult helpers.  The kids were pretty wild.  It wasn't one of our better days.  Oh well!
 
If it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend.  I need to be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush.  I will bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions.  Would that be okay?
 
Also, Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him.  He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help)  and I will take Nov 18 (Kim promises that he will definitely be there).

Toby,

Could you please take a look at the format of the outage postings.  Maybe I'm going at this the wrong way, but when I try to pull up a specific outage posting, I always get a whole set of outage postings.  For example when I try to pull up the chaim of postings related to the NNG MOPs 831 outage, I can't just pull up the specific posting, I also get other outages.  Why can't each outage posting be its own document?

  Yes, we can!!  My Bible Study starts at 5pm. I have an hour!  We may change 
the Bible Study to an earlier time though due to the Super Bowl and then I 
will have more than an hour. Either way...I know I will be there.  Please 
know I am praying for you for strength and perseverance as you contine to be 
with Enron. I am sure things are not really comfortable right now but I sure 
am glad they have a wonderful light of Christ's witness like you to be among 
all the darkness.  My heart is still mourning the gentleman who ended his 
life. I pray there will be no one else. Alina grows in leaps and bounds each 
day. I see her at ACEC and she is pure delight. She yells a greeting to me 
when she sees me and it lights up my heart.  I am not sure what she is saying 
but we know each other and it really thrills me to see her smile and her 
little hand waving.  She is such a blessing!  Everyone shows her so much 
love. At Sunday school last week we all really gave Chad encouragment and 
affirmation that he is now the big brother.  He seemed pleased and a wee bit 
shy about all the attention.  Hope and pray we were not toooo much for him.  
Shelly, if you ever get stuck for someone to keep the kids for a while...I 
would be honored if my schedule permits.  Just wanted you to know! 
Thanks for all you do and are doing! I can't wait to begin beating the drum 
for VBS.
In Him,
Patty

Hope your week is going well.  Here are a couple of things I wanted to tell you.

1.  I made the arrangements for the house rental, bought 8 baseball tickets each to two of the games where I thought day of the game seats would be hard to come by & got our airline tickets.

2.  Hopefully you got the invitation from Cyndi/Rosemary for Sat.  I know you have Karate plans that day so I understand if it doesn't suit you.  If you decide to come let me know though.  Grandpa is willing to come and stay with Chad (Kim will be in Indonesia), but I wanted to also see what D&T will be up to.

3. Does any day this week suit you for exercise - walk/run?

Shelley,
 
I want you to know how happy I am for you being able to finally go to Kazakhstan and complete the adoption of your  daughter.  
 
While you are gone, please try to think about work and Enron as little as possible.  We will put in extra effort to ensure things go smoothly while you are out.  I will copy you on any important emails and data requests to give you something to read through when you get back to Houston.  
 
Enjoy your first new days of traveling with Aliana (sp).  I'm sure you both will be somewhat apprehensive about the travel arrangements and she will be looking towards you to see if she should be frightened.  On Sunday, I asked my Sunday school class to pray for your safety, for uncomplicated travel, and for patience while wading through the governmental red tape.  My family and I will be thinking about you and your family over the holidays.

Hi, Ms. Corman.

This is Mrs. Jung.  This is my email if you ever need it for future
reference.  :)

Flat Stanley was sent in the envelopes provided from home.  I had the kids
put labels with the school's address on it in the return address corner.  I
also included an envelope with the school's address on it so that Stanleys
could be returned.  I'm glad to hear Stanleys are being anticipated.  I know
the kids are really excited about them.

I'm also glad to hear Chad's enjoying school.  We are definitely doing
harder work than Kindergarten.  We're actually doing different work than the
rest of first grade - more challenging, mind-stretching work, I'd like to
believe.

I was very encouraged by your letter and just wanted to express my
appreciation for sharing your thoughts with us.  Thanks again!  Let me know
if you have any other questions.


Sincerely,
Mrs. Jung

Here is my two cents...

From your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches 
overhang the condominium fence.  If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.  

The condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on
our property or destroy the tree.  

A landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is
obstructing a public road.   A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.  Since
the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a "negligence" issue.
Further, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm 
unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.  

If the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a "nuisance" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.  Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.

Bottom Line:  We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down.

Subject: Cutting Trees & Brush along our fence 


Greetings:

I spoke with Connie of Hunter's Point condominiums who asked that if they
could cut the trees and bushes along the fence line we share.
She said its on our property and thought that we should cut it since it is
on our property and blocking the view of the residents of the complex.

Advised her that it is currentl y not a problem for us and if Hunter's
Point trim the trees and bushes they must clean up any cutting and not
leave them on our property. Connie advised she would check with their
landscape company and advise.

Shelley, can you advise if we are required by any law to trim the trees and
bushes which block the view of an adjoining resident, I guess for good
neighbor policy and as we are a church we could do our civic duty, this
also raises the question, if we are blocking their view now, what happens
when we build the new Sanctuary and they have a problem with our roof
blocking their view?

Thanks/Regards

No, we live about 2-3 mi. off I-10.  It is really easy to get to our house from Austin by taking 71 to I-10 east. 


Here is a turn by turn:

Exit 1-10 at Highway 6 (17 mi. West of Downtown Houston).  

Go South on Hwy 6 to the 3rd stop light (Chevron station on SE corner).  Take right onto Briarforest Drive.  Take first left onto Briarhome (Meadowbriar subdivision).  We live on Scarborough Fair -- third street off Briarhome.  Our home is 2-story red brick & is in the NE corner.

14126 Scarborough Fair
Houston TX 77077
281-531-0385


Also last night I emailed Sergei a brief note regarding what Ginger was telling us yesterday. I didn't want to jump ranks or push him for an earlier date -- but I wanted to make certain that he knew that all our paperwork is in.

Shelley,
That sounds good. Fred and Marisa may go to the zoo. Do you live off of 290? 
That is the way we usually come.

Welcome back! I was wondering if you had 30 minutes today to discuss NNG's major customers from a strategic perspective.  Stan has asked me (on a very confidential basis) to explore various "buy back" options for NNG, including raising a lot of money!  I wanted to get your thoughts on certain customers' willingness to participate in an ownership interest in NNG.  I did not want to meet with Dave and his team given the Dynegy transition. I am free all morning except at 9 and this afternoon except from 2 to 4.

Hi Shelley,

Thanks for your message.  The best way to reach me is really at work (this
address), but I do check the home account a few times a week.

Anyway, how are you?  It must be wierd seeing your own company in the news
everyday.  Kim said that you were in a good spot to rebound if you needed
to when the dust settles.  That is a relief to us.

As far as the adoption stuff......we still have a long way to go.  Our home
study is being written up this week; we've finished the interviews and have
all of our documents into the social worker.  We are hopefully going to get
notification from the INS to get our fingerprints done within the next week
or so.  We're hoping the INS stuff goes quickly, because that is really the
only major thing we have left to get done.

We don't know where in Kazakhstan we're gonna go yet, but, we are about a
month from getting our name on the referral list; we'll probably find out
possible locations then.  I don't know how much Kim relayed to you, but
we're hoping for a healthy infant, and the rest doesn't matter as far as
preferences.  We are pretty excited already.

How is Alina? (spelling?)  Kim's description of her sounds wonderful.  You
guys must be having a terrific time getting to know each other again after
a few months separation.

Lets definitely stay in touch.  Maybe the next time you come through DC we
can have you over or meet somewhere.

Anyway, say hi to everyone for us.

Love,

Kurt

Congratulations!  TW has a great marketing department and I know that you will enjoy working with everyone.  Can we schedule lunch next week?  I would love to visit with you and share with you some of the things we have been working on to ensure a smooth transition.  I am available on Monday, Wednesday or Friday.  Tuesday is possible, I would need to move another appointment.

We will continue to schedule transactions with ENA and other Enron affiliates in a business as normal fashion.  If ENA's supply is cut, then deliveries will be adjusted, just as we normally do.  

Bob Superty, Dir of ENA Gas Logistics has asked to be notified of any ENA supply cuts.  I'm not talking about nits and nats that are part of the normal confirmation process, rather, I'm talking about if a confirming party refuses to confirm a block of ENA gas.     We are notifying Bob as a courtesy and nothing about this added notice should hold up routine business processes.

You can leave Bob a voice message at x 3-0957 or call me and I'll call Bob.  In any event, I also would like to be briefed about any significant cuts in ENA or other Enron affiliate supply.

According to the Certificate changes, which are filed with the state of Delaware, Article VII, Section 1 was deleted in its entirety and replaced.  The replacement language is consistent with the latest copy that I gave you earlier today.

In this same filing, a change was made to Article V, Section 6.  It states that the determination of how to fund a budget deficit will be made via a super majority vote of the Board.  The language is:

Section 6. A vote of at least seventy-five percent (75%) from the Board, including an
affirmative vote of at least forty percent (40%) from the Directors representing each Segment
within each Quadrant, shall be required to determine how to fund a budget deficit or to
establish or modify a promotional dues program.

The filing is dated August 3, 1998.

I need you to work out a full budget for this class & the Houston class -- =
both the customer portion + the individual employee travel expenses that wi=
ll hit our budget.  Once you have the cost estimate together, lets sit down=
 and make sure we're okay from an overall budget perspective and then make =
sure that the participating staff know that we need to stick to the budget.

What did we put in the 2002 plan for the TW contract training?

This order is even better.  It says that courts have founds that any refussal to allow a correction must be proportionate with the mistake.

I had Kim run down to my office to sign the revised letter and so I can fedex tonight.

I am so bummed about Jan. travel date and not having Alina for Christmas. Is this for sure? Was she speaking just about me or was she saying Jan 1 for you too?   Why Jan 1?  If there holidays are Dec 30-Jan 1, then why shouldn't we set out to travel around then, so we could have our court date the first days after their holidays?

Sorry for all the venting!

Shelley,
Chris called while I was gone. She told my mother in law that it looked like 
the first of January for travel. She also said if you had already done the 
letter, to cross out and initial the change. I called her back and left a 
message saying that if it is indeed the first of January, then you will have 
time to redo the letter, and not Fed-ex it today. I will let you know when I 
hear back from her or Ginger.
Let me know you got this email please.

Subject: Outline for Children-Family Christmas Eve Service



Attached is a copy of an outline of the children's Christmas Eve service
that 
I reviewed with Patty last night.  I have delivered a hard copy of the 
outline and readings to the Church Office.  Sorry to dash off an email 
without calling everyone -before I leave town.

Nancy - I'm hoping that you are still amenable to playing the piano.  If you

have selections that you prefer -- feel free to change my selections.  They 
were picked only because the kids know these songs.  It is particularly a
joy 
to hear them sing the chorus of "The First Noel."

Babara Thompson - I was hoping that you could ask the children at children's

church whether any of them are interested in volunteering to read for the 
worship .

Stephanie - I am hoping that you can line up an adult leader willing to play

overall MC and to read the Christmas message.  If you find someone- please 
let Patty know.  Otherwise I think she may be amenable to pinchhit.

Lisa C. - Could you please line up a greeter/door tender for the worship.  
And, also check with the trustees to make sure the sanctuary is unlocked in 
time.


Thanks everyone.  I just lover rattling off email orders!

Competitive Threats

Northern's competitive position is bolstered by the presence of (1) long-term agreements, and (2) a configuration of small-diameter branchlines with multiple delivery points that function as an extension of the LDC's distribution system.

Minnesota:
?	Northern's major Minnesota customers have contracts that extend through 2007.  Beyond current contract terms, there is a mid-high possibility of bypass in Minneapolis/Twin cities area (Alliance, Viking or Northern Border); low-medium bypass possibilities in Rochester and Mankato, MN (Alliance).
Iowa:
?	Northern recently extended the contract with its major Iowa customer (MidAmerican) thru 2005.   Beyond current contract terms, Northern will face competitive threats from NGPL in the Des Moines and Sioux City.

Wisconsin/Chicago:
?	With several significant contract terms up for renewal in 2003, Northern will face competitive pressures in the Wisconsin and Chicago areas because market prices are below maximum tariff rates and due to the high concentration of competing pipelines.   To some extent these competitive factors have already been recognized, as Wisconsin Gas has already bypassed Northern via Great Lakes.    The distance of competing pipelines to many Northern towns will preclude bypass for many others.  

Major competitors in the market area include:
?	Alliance
?	ANR Great Lakes
?	Natural Gas Pipeline
?	Northern Border
?	Trailblazer
Viking

Christi - here is the plaintiff malpractice reference from Cyndi.  Rick used to work with Cindy at Full bright and recently formed his own firm.  I know him and he's a great guy.

Caroline - Would you be amenable to renaming your weekly report?  There is some confusion that this report is the Gas Logistics report.  Thanks for your help.

Can you please check whether the 401K withdrawal was received on your end.  It looks like it left my account.

Also can you tell whether the check in from Bank One cleared?  It doesn't look like its in the account either.

I just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.

The final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases:

1. By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.

2. With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.

Commissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.  Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.  The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.  

The discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.  The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct.  -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.

You could never be a bother.  A woman serving food at a volunteer event always has a special place in my heart.
 
 
I bought the Louis Rich pre-cooked chicken & the caesar salad bowls (in plastic bowls - near fruit bowls) from Albertson.  Just added some extra parmesan.

Hi Shelley: 
I am helping to host a Girl Scout snack supper for 50 adults tomorrow evening, and I am thinking about making the grilled chicken salad like you made for the VBS planning meeting.  Can you tell me if you bought pre-cooked chicken, and if so where you got it?  Also, was that just romaine lettuce you used, or pre-mixed greens?  Did you toss a dressing in the salad, and if so, what kind? 
(Sorry to bother you with this - if you don't have time to respond I totally understand!) 
Thanks, 
Barbara

That's so sweet.  Sorry our time on the phone was short this morning.  As you well know, 6:50 AM is chaos at our house!

My sister is coming this weekend.  She arrives on Sat. at 11 AM and leaves on Tues.  Since you get home late Sat, I am anticipating that you'll want to sleep on Sunday.  Sunday afternoon we are going to Mary Beth Schatzman's birthday party at a Mexican restaurant.  Sunday morning the kids choir sings. 

Last night the Kudla's came over and we ate take-out.  Christopher broke one of the plates on the wall in the dining room and was very active.   I was pretty tired by the time I got everyone to bed.

Work is very stressful this week.  Tonight we are going to try to make it to Karate and we have to write out everyone's Valentine's cards.

I love you too.

Q,

I know this is early, but I wanted to tell you today so that you can go home
tonight and retrieve something that I left for you and the kids.  Open my
top drawer in my dresser in the closet and you'll find your little surprise.

Hopefully my little token will make up for me not being there on Valentines
Day.  I love you and I'm always thinking of my three Valentines.

Love Kim

FYI

Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of our gas controllers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. Evidentially the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.  

We are pursuing this matter with Bill Donovan and the building/security staff.

Mr. Chad is still sick today, but he much appreciated the bear.

I'll have my cell phone with me too.  We will be back on Fri. Mar 15.

Please look at your calendar to see if one of the following dates would suit for our shopping excursion:  April 4 or 5, 10, or 11.

FYI - Alina had her first MMR vaccination back in Jan and will have her followup in early April.  She purportedly already had all her MMR vaccinations in the orphanage but I am repeating just to be certain.

I've got an attic full of stuff for you and many, many Saturday's full of wisdom (and humility).

I was afraid she'd think I was being difficult if I mentioned my displeasure at being pushed into the holiday airfare timeframe, not to mention my concerns about missing Chad's Christmas events in December and our nanny holiday issue.
My gut tells me that we should tackle this by trying to get some sort of understanding about when translation will be completed and when our papers will be forwarded to Kazakhstan.  Because frankly telling us that we can travel 10 days after the other group means nothing if our paperwork hasn't been turned in sufficient time.

Shelley,
No, she didn't, and I was too upset about the late November time frame to 
ask. I was thinking about emailing her and asking her when the documents 
would be sent and about how long before we have a court date. I didn't even 
confirm that the 15th was a set date for the other group, but I assume it is. 
If we leave a week or so after them, that puts us leaving right at 
Thanksgiving, which means higher airfare etc...
Should one of us email her or call her and ask?

Can you send me the latest version?

Also, I am expecting to shortly have the power plant numbers to add for the 1 market and 1 southend power plant per year based on actual annualized revenues from a recent market power plan (Great River) and southend (PowerTex).

Danny,
 
Thanks for securing the Astros tickets for Gas Logistics.  On Monday afternoon I had everyone gather and we had popcorn and a drawing for yesterday's seats, the extra seats for today and this Friday's opening Aeros game.  It turned out great.  Even though I followed this democratic process -- the winners turned out to be exactly the people I wanted to reward.  I also made sure to have a leader in each group to buy the snacks.  Yesterday Brad took Jodie Floyd, Jerry Graves, and Tracy Minter,Toby Kuehl and Lanny Cramer.  Today Dannis Bellard, Dale Ratliff, Terry Kowalke and Steve Chambers are going to the game.  It was a great morale builder.  Thanks.  We'll try to do this again next week if we have extra tickets (Astros cooperating of course).
 
Today, Bill Murphy of FPL and Jude Campbell of TECO-PGS are coming to town to go to the game with Mike Bryant and I.  I'm also going to have a dinner for them after the game.  Perhaps at Irma's where hopefully Jack and Rachel will join us.  I'll have Ricki leave you a message if you are interested in stoping by.
 
Early this AM I'll be out speaking at Phil's Ops conference.
 
I'm going to call Julie to get on your calendar to brief you on some key logistics issues and talk about issues related to our current seating arrangements.

Subject: Guest List for Shower


Hi Shelley:
I am getting out invitations for the shower today.  I am sending one to you 
and Alina so you can see it.  Here is the guest list so far:
Giok Boothe
Lisa Corder
Linda Corredor (co-hosting)
Jacque Daughtry
Sydney Free Duvall
Peggy Erwin
Nancy Ginsburg
Dawn Goddin
Ange Grout
Wendy Houghton
Barbara Howard
Stephanie Keesling
Carla McGinley
Kathy Mynarcik
Becky O'Reilly
Dorothy Pledger
Letha Russell
Pam Thyssen
Ann Turney
Patty Wehn-Glowski

I do need to clarify the following:
1)    Did you say yes to inviting Tami Head?  (My notes aren't clear.)
2)    You listed Cherie Otto on your list.  I know that she and Barbara 
Bakanic are very close friends.  Barbara is also in our S/S class when she is 
not teaching.  Do you think we should invite both of them?
3)    You were going to get me Gabby's (sp?) address.
4)    I thought of Maggie Van Syckle.  Are you close with her?

If there's any one else you think of, just let me know.
Thanks,
Barbara

Dannis and Mike,

Due to Financial constraints in November and December, all orders were cancelled.  Therefore to reorder, I would need for you to send me an email with your SAP Coding, Business Purpose and Manager Approval.

I then take that information and have to get IT Director approval, VP approval, CIO approval and CFO approval - This is still in force and to replace your order, please send me the email.

Thanks, Karon

Stan told me that you were using that title too.  So I guess perhaps I negotiated another thing as well.  Seriously though I would like to talk to you about using common titles.

It's been canceled.  There were no unauthorized withdrawals.  It very well may be in the pocket of one of my blazers at home, but I didn't want to take any chances.  It's inactivated & I'll have to go to the local branch if I want a new ATM card with non-debit features.  The automated service only offers replacement cards with debit features.

I am looking for a way to assist a co-worker that is under stress with a wife with health problems, a baby and two other children at home.  I am interested in getting details about how I might pre-pay for a two-week personal chef service.  

Could you give me a quote on two-week service to this family located in the Copperfield area? 
Would you deliver the pre-made meals to the home?  Could the gift recipient select the menu items?

With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items:

1. When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the Enron building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.  I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.  It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it.

2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.  I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804.  The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern.  Perhaps, I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns.  But, if I did, perhaps other employees will as well....

I love Aigerim and visited with her on my recent trip to Taraz.  I took lots of pictures of Aigerim and
if you send me your mailing address I'll send them.  I am very interested in Aigerim's placement.  Let me know either way about your decision.  If you decide not to adopt her I would love to continue to advocate for her.

Hi, how's it going? Anything new on your end?
We heard from Ginger that a child named Aigerim who is from Taraz became
available.  She is from a different orphanage in Taraz.  She stayed in
the HOuston Area.  She is Kazak and speaks only Kazak.  She is five and
will turn 6 in March.  Did you meet any the kids from the Houston area.
Tonya Hoppe has sent me lots of pictures.  We are unsure and want to
wait until we are over to find a sibling for Anastasia.
I asked if they had a travel date, and Atwa told us no.  My work is
wanting to know when so they can find a replacement doc.  One of the
ATWA staff is due to travel on FEB 15th and she still does not have a
travel date.  Is this crazy or what?  I wonder if the other agencies
keep you hanging like this or if this is just our luck.   never boring,
tina

I looked up Nancy Kline's info. She is a nurse practitioner who also has a
Ph.D. -- a real underachiever.

I'm actually working with Mark Kline on their idea for an Ambassador Doll.
We are trademarking it.

I've confirmed that all four of us are covered under the TSF health plan as
of 1/1/02.  Furthermore, inoculations are covered 100%, so you should only

I'm planning on heading out the office around 3 PM or so.  Feel free to send home staff as business needs permit.  I'm not planning on sending out any kind of notice to all Gas Logistics -- as I feel like it is frustrating to those that must stay.

Have a safe and happy holiday.   I'll be in Austin tomorrow & Friday, so call me on my cell (713-857-2103) or email me if you need me.  In case of emergency, I can be reached at my brother-in-law's house in Austin at 512-474-5631.

Great Rosemary,
 
I'm so slow in thanking you for the lovely party.  You are the best.
 
My sister will be here for our lunch on Monday too.  We're going to be out shopping that day.

Subject:	FW: UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week


Okay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.  My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.

Subject:	UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week


Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Okay - so I see that it's Orlando Cogen (not Orange).  I'm unclear what the relationship is with El Paso.  Do they own 100% of Orlando Cogen?  Are they the designee?  Have they sent correspondence to us that El Paso is now owner or contact party for this contract?

Jimmy,  we could use a helping hand in collecting about $518 K from Orlando Cogen for their January reservation billing.  Marion has called them on several occasions this week and they simply are not responding to her messages.  We have several small customers we're still chasing, but Orlando is the most significant outstanding issue we have left.  Could you give me a call in the morning so we can discuss.  Thks! Sheila

Here are my edits to the FAQ document.  Sorry but I don't understand the pool allocation response.  

 

My notes indicate that we also need to answer the questions
- where storage allocation notices appear 
- why storage allocation notices come out at a later time.

Fixes already put in place
In the follow-up letter we categorize the feedback.  Can't we go one step further and say that we have already addressed some items:

- Make customers aware that they can call HotTap Helpdesk for calls
- Raise awareness of need to minimize mrongin meetings
- Haven't we taken a step to notify EDI customers about system downtime
- We have taken the step of immediately notifying customers of system outages
- Aren't we adding an injection/withdrawal indicators
- Can't we immediately change the confusing descriptors "storage analysis completed" vs "storage allocations completed"  {See my suggestion in FAQ}

Results of Monday meeting:
1)  Marion will continue to maintain a spreadsheet of outstanding shipper receivables for reservation, commodity and cash in/out balances.
2)  Marion will supply John K & Sally with an estimate on Friday for the upcoming week of expected cash flow based on the history of cash received (using Jerry's existing spreadsheet) and maintaining an ongoing daily cash receipts balance (at a high level).
3)  Reviewing whether the invoice due date can be moved up to follow tariff, ie, net 10 days falls on Sunday, can  invoice due date be on Friday (9th) prior to Sunday (11th).
4)  Jerry S will follow up with the SAP IT team to automate his report after reviewing report requirements with John K, Rick & myself.
5)  MS Reps will follow up with customers sending cash in to Enron office rather than lockbox or by wire.
 
We plan to give this a try for a month.  If problem arise, we will reconsider the decisions.

I signed up for the class today.  I live on the far west side of town (just S. of 1-10) so we'll have to leave around 7:15 AM to make it to class in time on Sat. Nov 3.  

Your family is also welcome to stay in our guest apartment.  The good thing about living on the west side of town is that it is only about a 2 1/2 hour drive from Austin.   I'll give you better directions later.

Chad has a soccer game at 9 AM on Nov. 3 -- so they'll be out and about very early.  I can drive to the conference so that your husband can have the car for a day of sightseeing.

Hi Georgi,

It's nice to hear from you -- although I wish it were under happier circumstances from your end.  I know that your visited with Mike and Steve on gas control openings.  Please also keep in touch with Rick Dietz for contract group openings and Lynn Blair for potential scheduling openings.  I'll also touch base with them and let them know that you may be responding to upcoming job postings.

Just a note to let you know that I have been looking for work and have applied and interviewed for several positions in gas control.  If you have any other openings available within the pipeline group in scheduling, contracts or accounting, I would appreciate any assistance you can offer. 

As you well know, I have a good work history and would be anxious to hear any input from you.  I really do need a job.

1. Expand the list of who is a marketing affiliate
2. Require pipeline to keep detailed records of communications with affiliates

Subject:	RE: affiliate rule


The FERC is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules, but I'll answer in the context of the current rules.

There are three main principles behind the current rules:
1. Pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate
2. Pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate -- unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info, and
3. Pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible.

There is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information, but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately.  For example, pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate -- we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better.  But, compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations - price, terms, etc. -- the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business.  There was a real case to this effect.  The pipeline & affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning.  The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting.  FERC found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline.

So, I'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info, but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions.

Shelley, dumb question, but I'm thinking in terms of general synergies for reorgco.  I am familiar with restrictions that prohibit operating info and preferential treatment to marketing affiliates of pipeline co's, but do the regulated pipeline co's have unrestricted access to the info from marketing affiliates?  My guess would be that the rule is asymmetric, but Enron always seemed to treat it as a two-way street.

On a similar note: in trying to come up with a settlement in the negotiated=

 is like letting them have access to our CAS system with us giving the fina=

Here is my recollection of the sequence of events. The concept of an operat=

standards.  FERC then picked up on this concept, added design capacity & sa=
id that the report needs to be updated at each nomination cycle in Orders 5=
87-L and in Order 637 transactional reporting.  GISB has since adopted stan=
dardized data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published i=
n GISB version 1.5 standards.  While these standard formats have been adopt=
ed, and I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet bee=

Stan/Rod,

I previously mentioned to you that I have assigned John Buchanan as Mgr, TW scheduling to ensure that we have a consistent focus on TW scheduling matters and presence at the 8 AM TW morning meeting (Lynn Blair, Steve January and Terry Kowalke are in the NNG morning meeting each day at the same time).

Previously Terry Kowalke and John Buchanan split time advising the TW and NNG team on day to day scheduling matters.  Terry was sitting on 39 and John on 42.  In light of the immediate change in their assignments, I asked John and Terry to switch desks.  I need you authorization to move their telephones.

This change is important to demonstrate to the commercial groups of both NNG and TW that we will not miss a step in tending to daily business even during the transition.  

Thank you for the support.

Are you at all worried that this starts the move to zone rates in the market area?  Do we care?  Are we worried about having competitive Zone E/F rates?

If all of marketing is in agreement and we can demonstrate the elements sufficently to include in the filing.  How will this work in the field area??  Doesn't this conceptually give everyone the same priority or we narrowing it down to within the MID?  MK

Subject: Re: Draft Order No. 637 Filing



In our meetings today on Order No. 637, we failed to discuss the topic of alternate point priorities "within-the-path". Marketing indicated in a meeting yesterday that they would like a change to alternate rights in the Market Area.  That change would provide that use of an alternate point within the operational zone where the shipper's primary rights are located would have priority over alternate rights in an operational zone where the shipper doesn't have primary.  This means we would have another level of alternate to be added to the tariff.  For example, if Minnegasco made an alternate nomination in Zone D at E.Dubuque, they would have a lower alternate right than Wisconsin Gas at E.Dubuque.
 
Please provide any comments you have on this issue along with your other comments requested to be provided to Maria by COB on Monday.  
 
p.s. I recognize this would fall into the category of "needing system changes so it may take awhile".

>>...here is the State Dept's Foreign travel requirements section for 
Kaz, showing a different HIV requirement!<<

Any idea what the Russian laws are with respect to HIV testing?  We 
were not asked to show proof of HIV testing to obtain Kaz visas or 
anytime (to our knowledge) that we were in Kaz.  However, we were 
asked by the consular staff at the Russian Embassy in DC to show proof 
before they would issue our visas.  It took three trips to the Russian 
Embassy to get our visas -- so it's possible the guy was just giving 
me the run-around -- but I'd be curious to know what the law says 
since Kaz families must return via Moscow.

We stayed in a hotel during our stay in our son's adoption city and 
then had an apartment during our stay in Almaty.  We personally loved 
having an apartment - it was "our time" with our son - we were able 
to start being a family and doing family things - playing, cooking, 
cleaning, etc.  Our life began together immediately - I think (and I 
don't know, since we didn't do this) if you were with a host family - 
it would put a different twist on the situation.  Not saying good or 
bad - just different.  Kind of like when you visit someone and stay at 
their house vs renting a hotel room.  You can be more "open" when you 
are with your own family.

Best wishes on your adoption journey. :)

Cyndi

I find all of this very interesting.  We traveled in June of this year

that we needed the HIV only if we would be there more than 3 months.  No
one ever asked us for the results in Kazakhstan or Russia, thankfully!

Subject: Accommodations in Kaz

I'd like to share the experience we had in Karaganda.  We stayed with a family in a small apartment adjacent to their own apartment.  It was a wonderful way to get our new son used to family life as well as have Russian speakers nearby to ease the transition to living with English-only speakers.

The particular family we stayed with consisted of a grandmother (retired schoolteacher) who was there ALL the time.  Babushka cooked all our meals as well and she and I became close friends even though she spoke only Russian and I only English.  The father was an engineer by training but was currently doing much of the document running necessary for the adoptions processed by our facilitator.  The mother was an ear/nose/throat doctor and there were 2 children (17 year old boy who spoke wonderful English and acted as our translator - for a fee of course - and his 10 year old sister).
    I would encourage anyone who has the option of staying with a family to do so.  It helps to see how families live over there as well as observe first hand how food is served.  They eat the same sorts of food we see all the time here but serve it differently.  That knowledge alone was wonderful to have when our son first came back.  I fixed the food in the manner he was accustomed to seeing it served.  He now eats the way we do (big plates and cooked in our way) and he's been back since 1 March this year.

Hi Everyone!

The tantrums just crack me up because of their similarities.  Of course, that's cuz we havent had one here in a week.  But, it is so typical for our kids to be "set off" by something that seems so simple, and then they end up hating themselves (I call it a "hate fest") and being self abusive.  Karly has told me during her tantrums that she is going to run away or kill herself, and she hits herself too.  How Kaz of her....yet her therapist says she's processing everything well and doesn't need to be seen every week.  But, it still is a worry for the future.....  


Here's a question.  If the kids are tantrumming and abusing themselves, doesn't that show guilt and self hatred?  Even though Kira doesn't feel bad about drinking the soda, doesn't she feel bad for doing a wrong thing?  Is the problem that she doesn't feel bad for hurting and disappointing the family?  Is this just misplaced guilt?

Here is an idea (and it is just an idea) about the conscience thing. The current behavioral theory with "normal" children is to discipline and consequence inappropriate behaviors without expressing anger, so kids don't feel shame or guilt.  So, would a way of teaching guilt include the parent sharing feelings of sadness and disappointment at the behavior?For instance, when Kira is calmed down, or at a later time, can you share your sadness that she lied to you?Can you on a regular basis model different feelings (it is totally hard for me NOT to model anger and frustration).  Just an idea.  

What do the professionals who you all are working say about conscience?    



Shannon, just once in a while, Karly has a positive feeling about her first family (such as when her birth parent bought her koolaid-wow there's a real  great parent, huh).  Anyway, I point at that it's good that at least she has ONE good memory about her, but when she begins sentimentalizing (?!) she is reminded that the nice kool aid lady also left her alone for hours, beat her, screamed at her and cut her with a knife.  This way, I figure she has a balanced perspective....

See you all later,

Denise

I have been trying to check out the requirements for Russian Visa's 
and Kazakhstan Visa's with several of the agencies that assist people 
in getting their visa's.  For both Russia and Kazakhstan, I have only 
found that it is required if you are planning to stay over 3 months.  

I wonder if it once was required for all traveling but is no longer??

decided to post directly to the list in hopes that I can share our experience.

We adopted our son, now 3 from Taraz in August of 2000 using Kids First/Frank 
Foundation.  

In answer to alot of your questions, We flew through New Yorks JFK to Moscow, 
that flight was 10 hours long and we arrived in Moscow in mid morning and 
were brought to a hotel close to the airport to eat and rest.  Our flight to 
Almaty left at 11pm.  We arrived in Almaty after a 3 hour time difference and 
I believe the flight was about 3 hours as well, so it was about 4am Almaty 
time.  Once we got our luggage and made it through customs to our 
coordinator, the sun was just coming up.  We then went to her flat to rest 
some more and eat breakfast.  (Although it seems like we had alot of time to 
rest, it was worth it to lay down as much as possible and relax to help us 
adjust to the time change)  We then went to the bank to get money that had 
been wired to us and then got our tickets for the train ride for that night. 
 I believe we got to the train station about 5pm for the train to leave about 
6pm.  We had our own cabin that had 2 padded benches with clean linens, 
plenty of pillows, a table and a window.  We were able to store our luggage 
under the bences.  The door to our cabin locked from the inside and we felt 
completely safe the entire time.  We took alot of video footage of the towns 
we went through.  There were people that would try to sell stuff at each of 
the stops.  Everything from bottled water to fried chicken.  The bathrooms 
were not the greatest on the train, but when you have to go, you take what 
you can get, although they were better than any port-a-potty I have ever been 
into here in the states.  Although I didn't visit other areas on the train, 
one of the people we were traveling with did and said you will see all sorts 
of people that are in non-private cars, but nobody ever bothered us.

We arrived at the Taraz train station around 4am and were met by the driver 
of the orphanage with his van.  We were brought to our host families flat to 
get settled and then went to the orphanage to meet our son.  Each day we were 
able to visit the bobek for about 3 hours in the morning and 2-3 hours in the 
afternoon.  Our court experience was short and non-eventful.  We were able to 
have dinner with the orphanage director at a restraunt by her flat.  We were 
able to go to the store everyday for bottled,noncarbonated water (and beer 
too)  We also visited the internet cafe which is just down the street from 
the telecom building.  It was very inexpensive.  We ate at a few restraunts 
in Taraz as well and never got sick.  One gentleman got sick from drinking 
some bad vodka, but said it was just like he drank something that didn't 
agree with him, he vomited once and was fine. 

The train ride back to Almaty left about the same time and we had no worries 
with our son.  We made a bed for him on the floor between our benches and he 
slept the entire time.  Another couple I know, made a bed for their infant in 
their small suitcase ontop of their clean clothes so the child wouldn't roll 
around.

One thing I can't express enough was the CHILDRENS CHEWABLE DRAMAMINE!  It is 
perfect and the last thing you want is a vomiting toddler on the plane.  It 
is messy and awful.

Also take lots of pictures!  While putting together my sons scrapbook of our 
journey to get him, I realized I hadn't taken pictures of things that now are 
important.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me.

God Bless and good luck.

We gave our youngest a two year "discount" -- which actually puts her in the

This was one of the best decisions we made early on.

>>My husband and I are discussing the pro's and con's of changing our 
soon-to-be-sons birthdate back a year.<<

We held each child back 1 year in school from their American age 
peers, but did NOT change their actual birthdates.

Initially, I felt strongly that we should change their birthdates by 
1 year -- but Jackson felt VERY strongly that we should not.  His 
logic was that after we opted to change their Russian and Kazak 
names -- the only "thing" they brought with them from Kaz was their 
birthdates.

The school district initially placed a GREAT deal of pressure on us 
to place them with their age peers, but we resisted and basically 
demanded that they be placed back 1 year -- which was within our 
rights to do -- although the school district tried to convince us 
otherwise.  They kept telling us that ESL would catch the kids up 
soon enough -- but given the fact that neither child had much formal 
education, we didn't feel starting them in 2nd and 4th grade was in 
their best interest.

So, although our kids were 8 and 10 years old when they came home in 
April of 2000, we started them off in 1st and 3rd grade.  The kids 
then attended 1st and 3rd grade summer school -- and we moved them on 
to 2nd and 4th grade in September 2000, just over 4 months after they 
came home.  

Academically and socially, they were really still about a year behind 
their classmates, maybe more, when they started 2nd and 4th grade 
last year -- but by the end of the school year they were almost 
working at grade level and were nearly on par socially with their 
classmates.

In terms of their sizes, which was a MAJOR driver behind holding them 
back 1 year -- I would say they were about in the middle of their 
classes in terms of their heights and weights when they started 
school.  HOWEVER, after being home for 16 months -- BOTH kids were at 
the 60th percentile for height for their AGES -- making them two of 
the tallest kids in their grades.

I don't have the exact figures on how much they grew -- but we know 
that in the first 18 months after Nicholas left the orphanage he grew 
more than 7 inches and Kira grew more than 6 inches and gained 11 
pounds the first year home.

We did initially consider holding them back 2 years from their age 
peers when they came home -- but we are VERY, VERY glad now that we 
didn't do that.  If we had held them back 2 grades instead of just 
one BOTH kids would have TOWERED over the other kids right now.  
Academically they would have been better off, but socially it would 
have been disasterous.  As it is now, the kids look noticeably bigger 
than many of their classmates -- which is incredible given how small 
they were compared to most of the other kids when they came home.

Anyway, this is what we did....

Laura

This is something that I have also considered for the child that I intend to 
adopt, in order to put her on a more even level with her "peers" here. She just 
turned 6, but is about the size of a 3 1/2 year old.

As far as I know, she has not gotten any formal schooling yet where she is, 
even though she would be in Kindergarten or 1st grade here by now. I want her 
to have every advantage to get the most out of her experiences in life, and 
feel that she will be best served by allowing her to be the "same age" as other 
children that are closer to her size and developmental level.

Subject: Bio - new member

Hi Everyone, 

This is the 'short bio' that was requested. It is
reprinted here. 
My name is
Vanessa and I am in the process of adopting from
Kazakhstan. I live in Connecticut. I have completed
the home study process but am waiting for one more
piece of paperwork to come back, that will make it
official. I've also started the INS process. My
homestudy agency is the Adoption Resource Center of
Connecticut and I plan to work with World Child on the
actual adoption. I have already been in touch with
them.
I am hoping to adopt two children as an older single
parent (no more than 1 boy). I would like the children
to be between 1 and 5 or 6 years old, and, if
possible, siblings.
I would like any information that I can get on the
process for the next stage of it, any information from
people who have 'been there' and I would love to
network with people who will be doing this as well.
Many thanks and I look forward to 'meeting' all of
you.

Vanessa

Subject: Re: birth dates

The hardest part about this decision, and the one I think some people 
don't think enough about, is what the child's situation is likely to 
be 2 or 3 years down the road.  

Nicholas was at about the 25th percentile for height (given his bio 
age) when we brought him home -- but is now -- less than 18 months 
after coming home -- at about the 60th percentile for height.  When 
we brought him home he looked to be about 7 or 8 years old -- but now 
looks every bit his 11 years old.

Kira was about the size of a typical American 4 year old when we 
first met her in November/December '99, although she was 8 years 
old.  She barely wore a size 6 when we brought her home in April 2000 
and looked by then to be about 5 or 6 years old.  Now, less than 18 
months later -- she looks like any other 9 year old -- and looks 
noticeably older than many of her classmates -- some of whom are 
almost 2 years younger than she is now.

We NEVER would have believed how much the kids would grow and change 
in such a short time -- and I'm sure it's hard for other parents to 
imagine, as well.  However, I also know what we experienced doesn't 
happen in every case and that many kids remain small or about the 
same size as their younger classmates.  Knowing what will happen in 
any individual case is pretty much guesswork...but you should think 
about how you will handle a situation in which your child is 
significantly older than his or her classmates -- but does not have 
the academic strenght to skip a grade later on.

Subject: Birth date adjustments

Just our two cents worth about changing/not changing birthdates.  We chose NOT to adjust our son's age because he was already showing signs of being on the tall side - even for a Kazak.  Liam was 8 (birthday is 17 Oct) when I brought him home on 1 March this year.  Within a couple of weeks of coming home, he was placed into a first grade in an Arlington, VA public school with ESL classes for 2 1/2 hours every morning.  This provided 2 things for him:  (1) he was placed with an age group that matched his social development plus (2) he was still getting ESL.  We found Liam was reluctant to mix with any neighborhood children until he started school and socialized with American kids.

Since we have relocated to the Jacksonville, FL area, Liam has entered second grade in Clay County.  Here the ESOL classes are total immersion so that he is in with children from a variety of cultural backgrounds but they are allowed to only speak English in the classroom.  He is also taken for special work with the Title 1 teacher as are some of the other children who lag behind in reading, English and/or math.

We've noticed considerable growth in Liam over the last seven months in terms of height and maturity.  If he catches up academically, we may consider skipping a grade.  However, we don't make much of a deal over the year or two difference between he and some of his classmates.  He is, by the way, not the only one his age in his class.  Guess we feel, as Laura said earlier, that his birthdate was really the one thing that was all his from Kaz and it is as much a part of his identity as his brown eyes and warm smile.

Subject: Re: birth dates

Could someone please clarify what is meant by "changing" their child's age?
Since their true age is part of their adoption records and visa(s), I assume
that you just mean to let them believe they are a different age.  Yet it
will be clear to the child immediately, if not soon, that they are engaged
in some sort of deception (no harshness intended), won't it?  Won't they be
inclined to want to tell others their "true" age?  Our 5-year old son-to-be
was very well aware of how old he was this summer.  A parent's wanting to be
understanding of their child's sensitivity to his/her
social/academic/physical lag compared to his/her age-level American
counterparts seems laudable, but I agree that this recourse should probably
not be entered into lightly.  I had a 14 year old in my classroom this
summer who came from Russia when he was 10.  Aside from a bit of lingering
awkwardness with some aspects of writing, their was remarkably nothing
socially to separate him from his classmates (and in math he was very
proficient).  On top of this, he was from a household where the parents
spoke almost entirely Russian around the house!

Some parents legally change their child's age at the time of adoption 
in Kazakhstan.  From what I understand this is "technically" 
impossible to do in Kaz and Russia -- but I do know of parents who 
did this during the overseas adoption process -- usually to make 
their child 1 - 2 years younger.

In other cases, parents either tell their child they are a year 
younger than they actually are -- and the kids believe this -- while 
in other cases parents discuss it with the child and agree to 
consider the child a year or two younger.

Parents in many states also have the option to legally change their 
child's age at the time of readoption, and sometimes can even 
petition a judge outside of a readoption.  Standards vary by state 
and sometimes by jurisdiction as to if/how parents can do this -- so 
it's best to talk with adoptive families in your community if you are 
considering legally changing your child's age.  For example, I know 
parents who simply petitioned the court without any 
supporting "documentation" as to why the child should be made younger 
who successfully changed their kids ages -- while other parents had 
to submit dental, medical and psychological records supporting the 
position that the child was "younger" than his or her stated age.

>>Yet it will be clear to the child immediately, if not soon, that 
they are engaged in some sort of deception (no harshness intended), 
won't it?  Won't they be inclined to want to tell others their "true"

Not necessarily.  Many of these kids have no idea how old they are -- 
and some "think" they are one age but are actually another (usually 
older) age.  It depends on what the practice is in the orphanage -- 
some recognize birthdays and group kids by age -- while others do 
little, if anything, to recognize birthdays or segregate the kids 
according to age groups.  Our kids knew how old they were, and the 
season their birthday was in...but I suspect that was ONLY because 
they were each in foster care and celebrated a birthday with their 
foster families just before their adoptions.

Diane,

Cindy replied back to ask you to take my contribution out of the payroll system.  And, that I should then call UW to bill me directly.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Hi Cindy,

I know this is a trivial question in the greater magnitude of things....so just drop me an email when you get a chance.

For my 2002 UW contribution, I asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in Feb.  (unsual bonus time).  Now, I want to have UW just bill me instead.  I can't seem to get back into the system to change this.   ????

Hi! I hope you enjoyed the rest of your weekend. The weather was simply
beautiful. We did some extensive yardwork. Luckily we didn't plant much
since it is supposed to be chilly this week.

Brianna and I loved the sing-a-long Sound of Music. It was great fun. I'd go
again next weekend!

Let me know which day is best for us to have lunch --Wednesday or Thursday.

Hi. Hope your week is going well.  I'm discouraged to still be sick (asthma or bronchitis or the like).
Also, I'm sure that you have heard the perils of Enron.  Then there is adoption stuff and then there is world news.  I am really hoping that you will have some time to be my therapist this weekend.  What would you think about tryin to coordinate hair appointments Sat?  My only constraint is Chad's noon soccer game.  If hair doesn't work then how about coffee?

You probably noticed that I will be out this Friday for the Mylogram.  This outpatient procedure will determine if I will require surgery on my neck to remove the bone spurs that are pinching nerves.

November 5th - 7th I will be on vacation in Phoenix.

November 14th Jury Duty that I rescheduled from July.

Still working on the holidays and at the moment I'm trying to stay here for Thanksgiving and out the week of Christmas.  I'm purposely scheduling this so I will be here while your out of the country, so please let me know if things change.

Will these dates work for you?

Thank you, Ricki

I got the call to travel to Kazakhstan for the adoption and will be leaving next Thursday, Dec. 13.  I will be in Kazakhstan over Christmas and hope to touch base with your daughter to see about the possibility of locating a Christmas eve worship.  I think I've misplaced her email address.  If you wouldn't mind, would you forward it to me again.  Thanks and have a blessed holiday.

Oh my perhaps I've given you the wrong idea about the sophistication of Chad's rock collection.  It consists of rocks he has picked up at the park and a few gems he bought at a museum.  He would love anything about rocks.

If I understand the question, the answer is that we only have to seek approval for corporate changes to TW, the regulated entity. We would disclose entities above TW in the corp chain for informational purposes.  FERC is interested for two reasons - to understnad that TW operates separately from its marketing affiliate and as part of determining TW,s capital structure and return in a rate case.  !

Rod:
For purposes of using an LLC in the model, is there some level of value that we think we can keep relative to the tax allowance?  I don't think assuming that you give away 100% of the value you derive from not paying taxes at the LLC level +  still having to deduct your ADIT from rate base makes a lot of sense.  There should be some middle point here.  I could be wrong however.  The reason I ask is that if we assume both TW and NNG are C-Corps and we need to make the earnings per common unit accretive (leaving aside the fact that the CASH distritbution per unit is very accretive), this may not work.  Shelley, any help would be appreciated.

Letter looks good.  Just a few thoughts:

- In addition to the categories of feedback and promise to work on these areas, should we provide a list of specific things that we have done?
- Should we attach the first round of FAQ that matches questions from the meeting?

Instead of referring to the ETS directors - lets put Lynn, Steve and your phone numbers in the letter?

I have been friends with Shelley Corman since 1985.  We have worked together and maintained a personal friendship through the year.  Shelley is a kind and loving person.  She is active in her church and in charitable activities.  I met her husband, Kim Erb, in 1997 and have been friends with Shelley and Kim as a couple since that time.  Both Shelley and Kim are loving parents to their six-year old son Chad.  It has been a delight to watch them raise Chad to be such a fine young man.  I believe that their home would provide a terrific environment for an adopted child.

Sincerely

Christi Nicolay

	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                Primary
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                                
                                Alternate
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
"RIMS" link, select "Docket#" and follow the instructions  (call
202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be
filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR
385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under
the "e-Filing" link.

I didn't get much of a chance to talk with you on Sunday.  Hope you had a
great Thanksgiving - and got some rest.

Did you get my e-mail with the inside of the program?  Will you be able to
print them up?  If not, just let me know and I can get them done.  Since we
didn't take pictures or get pictures drawn, we could just put "The Case of
the Missing Christmas" on the front wiht a magnifying glass and a manger
scene.

Also, I have found 3 of the angel costumes that we used last year and we'll
have to use something else for the 4th.  I'm making new halos that the
girls can keep if they want to.

FYI

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

Okay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.  My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.

Subject:	UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week


Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Subject:	JDF Walk for a Cure!



    
Well, I can't believe another year has passed, but it has.  Sunday, October 28th  is the Juvenile Diabetes Walk for a Cure! Again this year, I'm recruiting walkers for my team or simply asking for your support.  I know you hate to hear those pleading calls for more of your money, but I'm going to ask anyway - most of you know me well!  You see I have to.  As an insulin dependent diabetic myself, it is my obligation to do what I can to support every effort to find a cure for this disease which affects so many adults and children!  I know many of you see me deal with this disease everyday as I face it each time I put food in my mouth.  I follow my meals religiously with a shot of insulin along with several finger sticks a day to check my blood sugar.  It was only 4 years ago that I was diagnosed with diabetes, but your dollars are making a difference.  Within 2 years, they are expecting to be able to release insulin that can be inhaled which would eliminate the painful injections.  

I know that you have been inundated with organizations seeking your support to fund their projects and this has been especially true this year, but I hope that you will consider JDF one of the few that you continue to support as I do.  Please consider joining my team or one of the many other Enron teams and help us find a cure for Diabetes!  An Enron JDF t-shirt will be given to each walker or sponsor who contributes $25.00 or more!  If $25.00 isn't in your budget, you can purchase a "JDF Shoe" for only $5.00 and it will be posted at the Big E Caf? on October 26th.  As always, your contributions are matched by Enron!  Thanks for your support and I hope to see you on the 28th!

Lisa Sawyer

Hi Cyndi,

Chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for dinner pretty much anytime.  I know you are trying to tie up loose ends at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight.   How does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound? 

 Kim, can you pick up Chad and meet me there?  Gaby says she may take Chad to Lucas later this afternoon.  Please pay Gaby if you see her -- as I have given her the day off tomorrow.

Per my earlier email --- this is the maintenance company's response.

From: =09Lord, Randy =20
Sent:=09Monday, February 25, 2002 2:46 PM
Subject:=09RE: Elevator Maintenance


Yesterdays elevator problem was caused initially by a broken belt on the go=
vernor on Car # 21. This controls the speed of the car, and the car is desi=
gned to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than r=
isk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over tod=
ay to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The inter=
com in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explai=
n why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the=
 intercom is repaired.

There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the=
 bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance=
 levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by=
 the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which w=
e previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our s=
taff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequate=
ly staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on=
 site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had=
 over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of proble=
ms just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3=
,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we=
 have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still ac=
complished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise bui=
ldings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was=
 tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now.=20

While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practi=
ce to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of thei=
r functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security o=
r Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall =
them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past =
Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are i=
nterrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately=
 this time it was significant.=20

This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need=
 corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time =
it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security cont=
acted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then =
proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried uns=
uccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked=
 Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learne=
d that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler=
 at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Sch=
indler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elev=
ator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schin=
dler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted=
 in an extra hour before help arrived.

I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are =
no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an ent=
rapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the ele=
vators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if=
 the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for =
these inspections since they have people here at night. =20

I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yes=
terday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does=
 not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasi=
onally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not a=
cceptable.

Randy

Hi.

Sorry we missed rehearsal Sunday, but we are definitely still "transitioning." 

We will be out of town on Sunday morning at a family gathering and will not be in church to sing.  We will be at choir practice Sunday evening.

I'll look for March and April songs for the Cherubs.

The videotape of the Christmas program is cute.  Maybe we can find a time to watch it.

Hello, Ladies.

I will not be at choir rehearsal on Sunday.  Nancy has the music we will be
working on and will lead the rehearsal.

We sing at both services Sunday morning.  We are singing "We are the Light"
which we sang in September.   The choirs will sing together.   I will be at
both services.

Rehearsal went well on Sunday, but we were missing quite a few kids.  We
rehearsed "We are the Light".  They know it.   We rehearsed a song that
Nancy picked out for February - "Here is the Church".  I can't remember if
that's actually the name of it.    It is such a nice song, I think the
choirs should sing it together.  At one point, it goes . . . Here is the
church, here is the steeple, open the doors and see all the people.  There
are motions that go with that.    I think it would be cute if the Cherubs
sing that part alone and do the motions alone, at least the first time we
sing it in the song.

March is Palm Sunday.  Let's look for a cute song for the Cherubs to sing.
I think we'll re-use last year's song for the Sonshine Singers.

We need a song for April for each choir.   Steve mentioned he had a song
that he really liked, but I haven't seen it and don't know what type of
song it is.  We can take a look and see what we think.    We can look in
our books and find something for the Cherubs.

We started working on a song in the spring program that is to the tune of
"Take Me Out to the Ball Game."   We didn't get very far on it.  There are
a lot of songs to learn, and I'm shooting to have tapes ready by Sunday so
they can start listening to it.

I'm attaching a schedule.  The program date hasn't been confirmed.   I know
the confirmation class's mystery trip is that weekend.  I don't know
whether that will interfere or not.

(See attached file: Choir Schedule - Spring 2002.doc)

I've got three 4:00 - 6:00 rehearsals planned, but we may not need them.


Linda

First worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01. Total transport revenue is $180.6 million.  Other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates.  This information has been furnished to Kevin Howard.  The only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials.  I spoke with Tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for TW for this period of $200 M.  The difference is primarily fuel sales (which are not currently included in my numbers).

Hi Ms. Traylor,

I gave my mom a heads up that "flat Stanley" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like
recent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological
terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's
email.

Hope all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school.  At first he expected to be 
coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month.
Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.

I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what Chad needs to develop.

While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted
a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look
like Alina and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.

Regards,

Shelley Corman  (Chad's Mom)

Hi Shel,

Did you say that "Flat Stanley" will arrive in a white envelope?  I received 
a yellow envelope in the mail today with no return address, my name & address 
were typed and it had a "non-profit" stamp on it.  I did not open it.  It's 
in the trash can but the garbage man doesn't go 'til Thursday... I can 
retrieve it if you think it might be the envelope from Chad.

Love,
Mom

Mike -
I'll be out at the Ops. conference until 9 AM.  Could you please coordinate the meeting time at the Enron building with Jude/Bill.  Ricki I'm assuming that you have set our travel to ballpark.
 
Also, I want to make sure that we make the trip worth their while.  Mike - Can we quickly pull together dinner/happy hour plans (casual) downtown after the game (perhaps Ricki could reserve a spot for 10 at the old Irma's over by the ballpark) where Dannis, Steve, Jack, Rachel, schedulers, etc. meet us.  I need to leave downtown by 7 PM for a meeting this evening and I want to make sure that we have entertainment reinforcements.

Subject:	Data for Comments and for Economist's Report


In order to give some concrete statistics for our argument that midstream and  production affiliates are important links in the infrastructure with affiliated  pipelines (and, of course, that applying the NOPR to pipeline affiliates would  be a disaster), please provide data to answer the following three questions. Our  customer operations guys tell me this is a pretty straigtforward exercise.O bviously, given the 13 days until comments are due, time is of the essence. So  please respond by COB Tuesday, if possible.
1. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from an affiliated interstate pipeline? For all these interconnects, how much  gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
2. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from affiliated gatherers, processors, or intrastate pipelines? For all these  interconnects, how much gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
3. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that deliver gas  into affiliated intrastate pipelines? For all these interconnects, how much gas  flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
Additionally, Michael Doane, the economist INGAA has retained, would like to  have the following information for his report. It can be anecdotal, but having  something concrete to point at is critical. He needs all the examples we can  provide of existing infrastructure (gathering-to-pipeline,  processing-to-pipeline, production-to-affiliated gathering and pipeline) that  would not have gone forward if pipelines were not allowed to coordinate with  their midstream and production affiliates. If at all possible, state the natural  gas deliverability that's there today, which would not have been there. under  the proposed rule.
As you'd suspect, this also has to be done as quickly as possible. Get the  information to me, and I'll forward it to Michael.
Thanks for your help.

Attached is a copy of an outline of the children's Christmas Eve service that 
I reviewed with Patty last night.  I have delivered a hard copy of the 
outline and readings to the Church Office.  Sorry to dash off an email 
without calling everyone -before I leave town.

Nancy - I'm hoping that you are still amenable to playing the piano.  If you 
have selections that you prefer -- feel free to change my selections.  They 
were picked only because the kids know these songs.  It is particularly a joy 
to hear them sing the chorus of "The First Noel."

Barbara Thompson - I was hoping that you could ask the children at children's 
church whether any of them are interested in volunteering to read for the 
worship .

Stephanie - I am hoping that you can line up an adult leader willing to play 
overall MC and to read the Christmas message.  If you find someone- please 
let Patty know.  Otherwise I think she may be amenable to pinchhit.

Lisa C. - Could you please line up a greeter/door tender for the worship.  
And, also check with the trustees to make sure the sanctuary is unlocked in 
time.


Thanks everyone.  I just love rattling off email orders!

Would you guys be amenable to signing up the boys for Nature Explorer Camp July 29-Aug 2.  The Audubon lady said that I can sign Chad up with the 7-8's if he's going to be with a 7-year old buddy.

Summer Schedule
I'm not planning any camps for Chad the week of June 3 because of Swim Team (really busy first week of June).  

June 10-14 is Grace VBS

We'll be on vacation week of July 1-7

Ashford VBS July 22-26

Hopefully Nature Explorer Camp week July 29 - Aug 2.


I'd like to sign him up Biron's or some other camp 1 or more weeks (either):
June 24-28
July 8-12
July 15-19

We should change all refernces to say top 10 customers provide 66 percent of revenues .  I changed that in one prior draft.  The other figure is the top 15 contracts.  I think we should stick to customer figures rather than mix customer and contract stats

We found no cross-default provisions in the material contracts.   Moreover, FERC standards of conduct required pipelines to keep contracts, books and records separate from other Enron entities.

Subject:	Gas Control Security

Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some 
steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  

1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities
	- They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so.
	- They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.

	We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South
	hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard
	will be checking everyones card prior to entry. 

	We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and
	IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the	South door.

	We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation
	Center (EB42C1). 

2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone 
	
	We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared 
	to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS. 
	
On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics
business functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, 
and workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to
support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured
for approximately two weeks, depending on events.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Gary

Subject:	Message from Morris Brassfield - ETS Travel and Entertainment Card Announcement

I am pleased to announce completion of negotiations with Wright Express to provide a travel and entertainment program for Enron Operations Services Company.   Travel and entertainment cards will be provided to any individual employed by the pipeline companies, who is required to travel on company business.   Each employee will be required to complete the attached application and agreement form, secure management approval and fax to Mary Ann Johnson at (713) 345-3479.   The T&E card will be mailed directly to the applicant. 

Implementation
Employees may use the T&E cards for domestic and international business travel.  Monthly, each employee will be required to complete an expense report utilizing the XMS system, if expenses are incurred.  https://expensexms.enron.com/ewp/ .    Approved business travel expenses will be reimbursed to the employee via direct deposit or check, depending on how your payroll is currently processed.  Personal use of the card is discouraged.

The Wright Express travel and entertainment card has contingent liability, whereas, the employee's personal credit may be evaluated if:
*	Outstanding balances exceeding $3,500 or delinquent payments beyond 25 days past the due date.
*	A monthly line of credit for business travel exceeding $3,500.

Employees who are required to travel on Company business and expect to exceed the monthly $3,500 spending limit, may request a higher limit.  If you routinely require a spending limit exceeding $3,500 per month, please check the box under "Company Information" on the attached application form.  Your request will be submitted to Enron Operations Service Management and Wright Express for approval.  You will be notified of approval or denial concerning your request.
	
All travel and entertainment MasterCard accounts are due each month to Wright Express.  Failure, by the employee to pay Wright Express each month, submit expense reports or submit receipts may trigger card cancellation.

Procedure
The travel and entertainment procedure can be found on the ETS website at http://www.ets.enron.com/pandSM/Employees will be responsible to review this procedure and comply with all requirements.  Following receipt of the signed, approved application and employee agreement form, employees should expect to receive a T&E credit card within ten to fifteen working days, but no later than March 15, 2002.

Card Activation:
Upon receipt of the travel and entertainment card, you will be required to follow the instructions on the sticker using the activation call-in number.  Following activation, you may immediately begin to use your T&E card.

Rewards Program
Wright Express travel card holders may participate in a rewards program, which is outlined in an attached document.  All fees charged by Wright Express for the rewards program is the employee's personal responsibility. 

Please address all questions concerning the travel and entertainment program to Bruce Martin 713-345-1833, Cheri Sublet 713-345-3475, Mary Ann Johnson 713-345-3479 or Morris Brassfield 713-646-7006.

Mom forwarded a note that you were looking for Chad suggestions.  He is into anything about rocks, Harry Potter, or of course his all time favorite -- baseball.

I'm leaving for Kazakhstan tomorrow, so I didn't have time to ask for gift lists for your guys.  Chad helped me pick out some items -- that I hope they'll like.  Believe me, you will see the Chad influence when you open the items.   A box is on its way to you.

Have a blessed holiday.

Yes,  I volunteered to continue to keep up the flower beds again this year.  I was planning to pick up some flowers early Sat. morning at plant at the church.  If you want to meet me there around 8:30 AM or so that would be great (but please don't feel obligated).  I think we could get the planting done in about an hour.

Congrats to you on your recent wedding.  I am so thrilled for you both.

Here is my recollection of the sequence of events. The concept of an operationally available capacity report and what it contains are already in GISB standards.  FERC then picked up on this concept, added design capacity & said that the report needs to be updated at each nomination cycle in Orders 587-L and in Order 637 transactional reporting.  GISB has since adopted standardized data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published in GISB version 1.5 standards.  While these standard formats have been adopted, and I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet been adopted by FERC -- so other pipelines may or may not yet be following.
 
I'll try to look at the NGPL posting over the weekend and compare to ours.  Also - I'm sending your email to Theresa Hess to confirm my recall of the standardization.

Indicated Shippers in their Reply to our Reply brief (at 19) argue that we implied that our capacity postings are consistent with the standardized Gisb format.  They compare our postings to NGPL's, which are different, to support their argument.  Then they conclude that there is no standardized GISB capacity-posting format.  Is this true?  How can we respond if this comes up at oral argument tomorrow?  Maria

I'm thinking that we may miss church altogether on Sunday.  We may spend the night at my inlaws in Conroe.  They have been bugging us to visit and I don't see another date on the calendar that will work.  Nov 3 for example, there is no children's church, but I am open/close trustee.  Don't worry about the CD player -- it's no problem.  I don't mind exchanging it until we get a CD player and duplicate copies of music (which I'm working on).
 
We received our INS approval to adopt Alina, but with court date delays etc., it looks like our most likely travel time is late November or early December.  When I get a little better info.  I will make Children's Church plans.  If it turns out that I'm gone several weeks in December, then perhaps we can talk Patty into letting the kids sit in regular church during Advent.  It is always such a fun time for them to be in church & they recognize so many of the songs.  If I'm only going to be gone in late Dec & first week of Dec, then we can probably continue with Children's church as planned.  I'm really just guessing now -- since this international adoption stuff changes by the minute.

Will you be at 8:30 service?  If so I can get the CD from you then.  I really need to buy a CD player - maybe I can do that by Saturday so we don't have to pass yours back and forth.  I'll let you know if I'm successful.

I didn't get much of a chance to talk with you on Sunday.  Hope you had a
great Thanksgiving - and got some rest.

Did you get my e-mail with the inside of the program?  Will you be able to
print them up?  If not, just let me know and I can get them done.  Since we
didn't take pictures or get pictures drawn, we could just put "The Case of
the Missing Christmas" on the front wiht a magnifying glass and a manger
scene.

Also, I have found 3 of the angel costumes that we used last year and we'll
have to use something else for the 4th.  I'm making new halos that the
girls can keep if they want to.

I'll be at the meeting Friday.  Caroline tells me that it is strictly a revenue review - no O&M.   Do you want to go over just revenue with my team or both revenue/O&M?

Shelley,
       I haven't seen any invitation list for Friday's Plan Review with Stan yet, but we are up at 10:00 and will go until 1:00.  I'd like you to be in through the whole thing if possible.  After that, do you think that you and I should walk through the whole plan with the key people in your group (and maybe Steve's)?  Give me a call if you haven't received the Plan handouts by tomorrow.  Thanks.

Subject: SPRC Meeting


Shelley,

What do you think?

Beez,

Since our telephone conversation concerning the special SPRC meeting, I have
prayed/thought about the topic and have the following opinion.

While I agree that this decision has to be made with the good of the entire
congregation in mind, I would like to say that my family and I feel that our family and the
congregation have benefited from Ernie's practical and humble approach to Christian living.

We have witnessed Ernie handle delicate situations with compassion and
consideration.  We also appreciate Ernie's support during Alina's difficult
transition to our home and at ACEC.  

Ernie may not deliver the most inspiring sermons, may not be as outgoing as prior pastors at
the church, and may not display managerial qualities in dealing with church staff. Certainly these are important considerations, and perhaps the most important considerations for a pastor of a church the size of AUMC. 
But, I just want to make sure I raise up those gifts that I think Ernie has brought to the
church.  Ernie is the type of person that helps to fix a flat tire, helps pack up the folding chairs after
an event, or gives a stranded member a ride home.  In some ways it seems to me that Ernie is more comfortable
leading by quiet example than being a formal leader.  I believe that it has been good for our congregation to
see that a pastor can get his hands dirty in the process of pastoring to his congregation.

Having said this, both Shelley and I realize that we don't have the day to day contact with
Ernie in the church office setting and don't see the managerial issues that have been raised.  Furthermore, we don't
believe we can afford to have AUMC's membership adversely affected if we intend to grow this church to minister to the needs of our growing community.   In summary, Ernie has my family's support if there is any opportunity to work through the concerns that have been raised, but AUMC is our home and whatever is best for AUMC, that is the direction we should take.  I will support the SPRC's decision.

Hi Mrs. Traylor,

Obviously things have been a bit chaotic in our family life as we try to get Alina ("Chad's new adopted sister) settled into our routines.  We have been trying to keep Chad's routines as normal as usual, including bedtime and homework time.  While he seems happy with school, I have noticed decreasing marks on his homework and practice tests.  This especially concerns me with respect to his math -- where he has always been an excellent student.

Do you have any suggestions to help Chad with timed practice tests?  Do you recommend any particular classes (Kumon, etc) or workbooks?  If you think it is appropriate to meet to talk about Chad's progress, I could come to school anytime this Friday, February 1 for a conference.

Thanks

I'm confused how this fits in with the projects that we recently had Dynegy approve.  Is this one of the discretionary network upgrade projects that they agreed to support?  Or one of the other discretionary projects that we didn't have funding for before 6/30/02 anyway?

Shelley and Steve,

As you know, we have been working with facilities to develop options to replace or improve our 75KVA UPS that provides power to the Gas Control environment. My recommendation at this time is that we stand pat with the current 75KVA UPS and the redundancy that we currently have in place. Given the uncertainties of the status and ownership of the 40KVA UPS on EB44, and given Mr. Cooper's stated intention of moving out of this building, it simply doesn't make sense to spend the $28K estimated to leverage the 40KVA UPS on EB44. I've talked with Randy Lord and he is comfortable with us continuing to rely on the 75KVA unit for the near term. 

I do want to thank facilities for their efforts, particularly Charles Upshaw, who provided a great deal of assistance in reviewing what equipment was available and how we might leverage the equipment.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Gary

Jennie,

I made it home last night, but have been unsuccessful in resolving Kim & Alina's travel arrangements.  I have only been able to get the answering machine at your office this morning.

I need to get Kim & Alina on flights home on Wed. Jan 9.  My current thinking is that it may be better to take a refund on the Lufthansa return tickets (since the Moscow Lufthansa office doesn't want to reissue) and to instead prepay tickets home for them on a flight path that only requires one change ?

Please advise

I already had Donna prepare a revised budget with people assigned directly to pipes and no cross pipe allocations.  It is rough still -- but looks like we can stay within budget for each pipe.

Sorry but I don't have an isolated power plant capex number. 

In the NNG commercial folks original budget they forcasted $1.2 M revenue growth from $25 million 2002 Capital.  So my thought is that if you have already included maintenance capital = depreciation, then $25 million capital includes market area expansion as well as power plant growth.

One question, on the $1,000,000 margin per additional power plant that we are assuming for growth, is there any capex associated with that growth?  What about any increase in O&M expense?

Thanks,

Hi Becky,

I'm thinking of you.  Cynthia Corcoran called today to see if I knew anyone interested in doing regulatory work.  I thought of you right away and Cynthia was enthusiastic, but didn't want to violate your privacy by giving out your email address.

She can be reached at 713-533-9180 or I can give her your contact info if you prefer.

Hi Ginger & Chris,

Hope you are doing well.  Just wanted to check in and make sure that you received the notarized copies of my INS approval.

When I spoke with Ginger a few days ago, she said that she thought we would travel 10 days or so after the Almaty group, probably in late November.  

After I get off the phone I always think of  questions I should have asked.  Since my questions are not critical, but process in nature, I thought I'd drop an email.  
I am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel.  How long does translation take?  What happens after that?  When is the dossier sent to Kazakstan?  Typically, how much notice are people given of their Kazak court date?

I would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the Christmas holiday -- as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in Houston. 

Sorry for so many questions.  I know that you are both very busy and I know that patience is definitely in order with this process.  I am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that I am realistic about the steps involved.

I'll try to attend this meeting if you need me.  I have a CLE class out of the office from 12-2 today.  But, I would like to dispel the suggestion that Jerry put together the spreadsheet for me.  I'm very enthusiastic about the AR tools that Jerry & Jim have developed and I'm happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks, but I feel like I made it clear that the customer service reps (like Marion) that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of Jerry's reports.   If the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs -- then it should be modified.  I'm all for automation and less manual intervention.

Shelley--If you have time on your schedule, would you also attend this meeting.  The reason I've scheduled this meeting is to determine exactly what it is John Keiser needs for cash flow analysis and what we can do to automate Jerry's process such that it doesn't require so much manual intervention and is more dependable.  (Marion spends too much time reconciling to Jerry's spreadsheet when she needs to be contacting customers for collections.)  I believe Jerry put this together for you, so your thoughts would be appreciated.  Sheila  (We're meeting in EB3907 at 2:30 pm.)

Does Fri at 10 work for you?  I may be in tomorrow too after I make sure Alina won't freak out with the babysitter.

Next week sounds fine for vacation.

I wasn't able to use the global phone in Kazakhstan. But a friend recently rented one and used in Europe.  The neat thing is that you use you're reg cell number.

Playdate sounds great

Talk to you tomorrow.

Almost 100% certain that its just me.  I'd rather have good flights and spend the money on just me (i.e. we can share hotel costs).

Shelley,
I also found out that Luth. did fly out of Houston. They were sold out on the 
10th and only had 3 seats on the 11th.  I will do more looking when we know 
for sure the dates. If the prices are really high, then Fred may stay home, 
and I will go. Is it looking like just you, are is Kim going also?

I'm fine with the 1-2% growth rate, but think we need to make an assumption about the major contracts that expire 10/31/03.

Subject:	NNG 10 year valuation model

I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -

1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the "Dynegy transition" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption. 
2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now. 
3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the "contract roll off" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption 
4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more "reasonable" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 
5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.

Thanks,
Kevin

Shelley,
 A reminder notice was posted today for TW customers about the implementation of the new CMS/Capacity Release system this weekend. 
Just wanted to let you know that I was going to come in the office Sunday morning as back up for the TW group just in case there were any issues from the implementation of the CMS/Capacity Release system. 
Ramona, Linda Trevino and their team will also be in the office Sunday morning for support.

Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.

Jan if you are here today can I get you to help me out with some info.  The most important thing I need is actual volumetric data going back and projected as far out as you have it.    You can see the splits between the gallup volumes, red rock and the pre existing deals.   I also need to verify the capacity added from the expansions.   Also need to begin to detail the volumes from Long term firm contract versus short term deals including IT etc.

Subject:        Additional TW information request 

Rod, 

Following our conversations today it appears necessary to include more granular information in the transwestern model.  We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers. 

This information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for "reverse synergies."  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.

I don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.  

Please let me know if you feel the template does not capture the relevant information.  I will be in at 7am tomorrow if you would like to discuss this information.  

Jayshree and I also have additional information requests from our conversations of the last two days, but I will send that information in an e-mail tomorrow.   

Thank you, 
Sarah

Does that mean Rita will need to go through security every day?  My preference is to give her a temporary badge or activate her old Enron badge for the full week.

Holly, I work for Northern Natural Gas Company and in March we are going to be working on a rate refund for our customers.  Usually when we do this, we need the help of Rita Bianchi who was a Northern employee until February 1, 2002 when she became a Dynegy employee.  I was wondering if we could get Rita's badge (#40024) activated for the time that she will need to be down here to help with the rate refund which will be from March 18 thru March 24.  She will need access to the 42nd floor which is the floor that I work on plus the 40th floor which is the floor that our IT people work on.  Please let me know if we can get this to work since that would make it so much easier for her to come and go for the time that she will be down here with us.

Sure -- Let me first make a run at the business needs and then prior to the=
 general notice email, I'll take care of charitable requests.  Good idea.

This isn't the language that we ageed on and it will cause serious objections from my camp.  I thought I sent Jim an email over the weekend.  

The language needs to say that Enron has advised that it is willing to treat UBS as an affiliate. .  We cannot say the interstate pipelines are agreeing -- as this would take agreement of our partners.

Sorry I missed you today.

Looking forward to lunch tomorrow.  Will 11:45 at La Grilia suit you?

Have fun at your event tonight.

Also - mea culpa.  I just replaced my daytimer calendar for 2002 and realized that I missed Matt's birthday.  I hope that wasn't the day we were all over at your house.  Oops.  Wish Matt a belated greeting on us and of course congrats on his promotion.

See you tomorrow.

Shelley,  FYI--Rick & I have discussed how we will cover the reservation billing scheduled for Saturday.  Marion & Cynthia will assist us in the coverage as well as Jerry Skirtich who sat  with Galen & I on Tuesday to cover the ncessary steps to generate the billing process.  Galen has a "desk procedure manual" assembled that spells out in detail the billing process.  I'm working w/Larry Hill to ensure the Capacity Release transactions are fed to the old TSS system (still testing this process.)  I've expressed a great sense of urgency surrounding the invoicing process given the cash flow concerns we're dealing with.  Sheila

Galen's heart catheterization yesterday showed two major blockages, one 99% and the other 75%.  The doctors at St. Lukes installed two stints in the artery to repair these blockages.  Galen said his chest is pain free and the tightness is gone.  His incision on his thigh is very sore and he has not yet been allowed to get out of bed to walk.  I spoke to him this morning and he sounded fairly upbeat and said he should be out of the hospital later on today.  He was concerned about whether he would be able to come in to work on Saturday to process reservation billing.   I assured him that Sheila and I had it covered and he did not need to worry about it.

I thought you'd get a chuckle out of the email below -- especially the part where he copied Stan.

This is some unsolicited feedback I received on the presentation I gave to Phil's staff.  I'm not quite sure what to make of the fact that he was "sold" on my seriousness.  Evidentally there was some issue......

Shelley . . . 

Looking over my notes from the Operations Directors Conference, I am reminded of what a fine job you did delivering your presentation and I thought I'd provide you this feedback.

I felt you clearly conveyed your information in a manner that engaged the participants and helped them understand and retain your message.  Specifically, you organized your presentation in a logical sequence, you spoke distinctly with varying voice inflection and without "umms" (a very difficult thing to do!), and you related well to your audience through a friendly tone in your voice and in your body language (smiles, eye contact and open posture).  Watching and listening, I both "liked" you and felt "sold" on the seriousness of you and your group in executing the duties of your function and providing effective customer service.

To improve the effectiveness of your slide show, you might consider reducing the number of bullets in some slides.  As a general rule, slides become "busy" and impact the receiver's comprehension when the number of bullets gets past about six; so, I suggest that you limit the number of bullets in any one slide to 5 or 6 and break up a list any longer than that into two or more slides.  This will make your audience more comfortable and enhance their retention.

Thanks for the effort and energy you put into your session.  I learned helpful new things about gas logistics and enjoyed your presentation.  You were very effective.

Regards,
- Roger

Copy:  Stan Horton
(Note to Stan - I had to step out while you were speaking; so, please don't expect this level of feedback on your presentation, though I'm sure it went just as well!)

Our team holiday potluck luncheon is scheduled for Tuesday, December 11 at 11:30 AM.    So dust off those cookbooks and sign up to bring a culinary creation.  The sign-up sheet is located outside Ricki's workstation (4268A).   The buffet will be set up in 42C1 (the gas control presentation room).  Room 42C2 is also reserved for seating.  

Following our luncheon, we will have a Gas Logistics staff meeting at 1 PM in 39C1.  We can discuss any Enron updates and I will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have.    

At the end of our staff meeting, we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing.   We have lots of fun prizes, including many sets of sports tickets.  All Gas Logistics employee names will be entered.  You need not be present to win.

Finally, I want to fill you in on my upcoming journey.  My husband and I have been trying to adopt a young girl from Kazakhstan into our family.  The paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and I was having doubts whether it would ever happen.  Early this week I received the call that I need to travel to Kazakhstan next week to pick her up.  While I am excited to complete the adoption, I'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time.  At our staff meeting, I can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence.

I'm looking forward to our get together next week.  To the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, safe and relaxing holiday season.

I talked to Ginger this morning.  She received my dossier and is sending it for translation.  She said she will be at Chris Ivins today reviewing dossiers.  She also said that there is a possible change in document requirements that would require that certain documents be "apostilled" in Austin.

I asked Ginger to send you the picture of Oksana.  She said that she thought she had already had.  She said she left you a voice message & would try to call you again later.

Talk to you soon.

Jennie - This looks okay if I wait for my husband or Liz to go on the 20th -- although I think the return would need to be extended a  day or so.
 
Could you also see about if I am traveling alone and wanted to change my ticket to leave Sat.  I was searching the Internet and it looks like the Lufthansa flight is still available on Sat.
 
I need to make some quick decisions about what I'm doing tomorrow.

FYI Regarding Mn EC Closing.

I really enjoyed our talk last night.  You gave me some really good advice.  

I'm sure that vacation/going out of town is the very last thing that you feel like thinking about, but when you're up to travel thoughts let me know if you would be interested in going to the Hill Country Hyatt some weekend.  I think Alina would love the water rafting.  We could go the weekends of May 11, 18 or 25 if you are interested.

Talk to you soon.  Chad really, really wants to have Tom come over to play soon!

Subject: Closing of ENNEC Department
Importance: High



-- 

Dear Alumns,

I'm sorry to have to convey the bad news that the Penn State 
administration has decided to close the Department of Energy, 
Environmental, and Mineral Economics effective July 1.   This 
decision stems primarily from massive budget cuts confronting the 
University in light of a significant decrease in state appropriations 
and of a continuation of increasing costs of higher education.  Also, 
despite acknowledged progress in Department accomplishments, we are 
still lagging other EMS departments in major areas such as student 
credit hours and external funding.  Finally, it is easier to close a 
small Department, and one that is sometimes (and erroneously) viewed 
as duplicating educational efforts in the economics area, than it is 
to close a larger and more unique department in the College.

Fortunately, the University is formulating a plan with many positive 
aspects for our faculty, staff, students, and with respect to 
coverage of our fields of expertise.  Tenured faculty will be 
shifting their appointments to other units in the College 
(Meteorology, Geography) and elsewhere at Penn State (Business, Ag 
Econ).  The staff has been promised at least equivalent opportunities 
in EMS.  Continuing students will be provided the necessary courses 
over the next two years to graduate.  New educational initiatives in 
Environmental Risk Management and in Energy Business, and new 
research initiatives associated with Penn State's new Environmental 
Consortium will also serve to continue our intellectual tradition.

Still, there is no way of getting around the news that a wonderful 
educational entity that has been home to so many wonderful people and 
has contributed so much to education, the State of Pennsylvania, and 
the larger world community, will soon cease to exist.  Please know 
that our Department has worked valiantly for many years to amass 
accomplishments that would stave off such a decision.  As Head of the 
Department over the past fourteen years, however, I feel that I bear 
the ultimate responsibility for this outcome.  I only wish that I 
could have done more.

I regret that I have not kept in better touch with many of our 
alumns.  Recently, and facilitated by the ease of using e-mail, we 
had planned to start a semi-annual Alumni Newsletter.  The current 
situation actually makes this even more imperative-the Department may 
no longer exist but our Alumni Association can prosper indefinitely 
if we participate actively in it.  Let me encourage you to spread the 
word about our situation to alumns who have not received this 
communication and to ask them to send me their e-mail addresses for 
future communications.

A degree from Penn State's Mineral Economics Department, or the 
revamped Department of Energy, Environmental, and Mineral Economics, 
has served our alumns especially well over the past five decades. 
There is no reason that it should not continue to do so.

Thanks,

Adam Rose
Professor and Head

Shelley,  FYI--Rick & I have discussed how we will cover the reservation billing scheduled for Saturday.  Marion & Cynthia will assist us in the coverage as well as Jerry Skirtich who sat  with Galen & I on Tuesday to cover the ncessary steps to generate the billing process.  Galen has a "desk procedure manual" assembled that spells out in detail the billing process.  I'm working w/Larry Hill to ensure the Capacity Release transactions are fed to the old TSS system (still testing this process.)  I've expressed a great sense of urgency surrounding the invoicing process given the cash flow concerns we're dealing with.  Sheila

Galen's heart catheterization yesterday showed two major blockages, one 99% and the other 75%.  The doctors at St. Lukes installed two stints in the artery to repair these blockages.  Galen said his chest is pain free and the tightness is gone.  His incision on his thigh is very sore and he has not yet been allowed to get out of bed to walk.  I spoke to him this morning and he sounded fairly upbeat and said he should be out of the hospital later on today.  He was concerned about whether he would be able to come in to work on Saturday to process reservation billing.   I assured him that Sheila and I had it covered and he did not need to worry about it.

Hey all,

Can I get a copy of the settlement bullets sent to FERC staff and indicated shippers.  Lynn, Darrell, Brad & I are working on ideas on how we could revised current posting and customer point/path/segment look-up capabilities and are interested in learning whether our revised capacity procedures are any more specific than in the earlier draft we looked at.

Attached is an executive summary of the NOI on Electronic Service of Docume=

llow individuals to receive documents through email without the need for in=
terventions just to be kept informed of the proceedings. FERC is making two=
 proposals, one for service to parties and one for service to individuals f=
or a cost (FERC states cost recovery but no specifics).

Comments are due November 2. Joe has asked that I coordinate comments for o=
ur pipelines. Let me know who you wish to participate.=20

Hope your holiday was a fantastic one.

My dossier info was not picked up from the embassy last week, so now I'm another week behing in the process.  But, the delay does perhaps give me a chance to take care of my sinus problem.  I've still been feeling cruddy and want to have a specialist look at the sinus polyp.  Can you recommend an ENT?

Looking forward to seeing you soon.

The FERC is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules, but I'll answer in the context of the current rules.

There are three main principles behind the current rules:
1. Pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate
2. Pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate -- unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info, and
3. Pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible.

There is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information, but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately.  For example, pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate -- we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better.  But, compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations - price, terms, etc. -- the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business.  There was a real case to this effect.  The pipeline & affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning.  The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting.  FERC found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline.

So, I'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info, but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions.

Shelley, dumb question, but I'm thinking in terms of general synergies for reorgco.  I am familiar with restrictions that prohibit operating info and preferential treatment to marketing affiliates of pipeline co's, but do the regulated pipeline co's have unrestricted access to the info from marketing affiliates?  My guess would be that the rule is asymmetric, but Enron always seemed to treat it as a two-way street.

Liz,

I spoke with Ginger today to tell her that my notarized INS approval is in the mail.  She said she is really busy because Chris is on vacation.  She reiterated the point that you made that there is another group traveling to Almaty before us.  They are not traveling until Nov. 15.  We will be after that -- perhaps a week or 10 days later.   

This journey is certainly full of ups and downs.  I was thrilled to receive INS approval and am now discouraged about not traveling until late November or early December.  

I was thinking about making an appeal for us to go before the Almaty group.  What do you think?  Perhaps you have better standing for such an appeal given your health concerns for Oksana.

Sorry for the delay.  My wallet and checkbook were stolen on Fr night & I spent all day yesterday getting things in order...after the thief charged $6000 on my credit and debit cards!  Remember that conversation we had about 2001.
 
I did little research on Compuserve and AOL.  Both have acess numbers in Almaty Kazaknstan -- where I'll be at least 1 week of my journey.  Looks like they both use the same access numbers and both charge a $6 connect fee.  So I don't see the advantage of adding AOL -- unless you see something I don't.  Here's the catch -- neither has service from Moscow.  So I'll be out of lunch in Moscow unless I can find an alternative ISP.  
 
I'm at regional type hotels in Kazakstan.  But, I'm staying at the Grand Marriott in Moscow.  Surely they have some sort of ISP access.
 
My current ISP is Compuserve.  Mail address:  cormanerb@cs.com <mailto:cormanerb@cs.com>;  User:  cormanerb;  password:  chad4erb.  I currently have version 5.0 loaded -- there is a 6.0 available but I haven't had a chance to download.
 
My Enron password is also chad4erb.
 
I'm at the house (281-531-0385)  if you need any other info.

Sarah,

Attached is TW revenue detail by contract for the years 1997-2000.   At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date.  

For example, for calendar year 1997:
Short-term  = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98  + all IT & PNR revenues
Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond.


Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000.

Call me at x37083 if you have questions.

Sorry I'm so slow in getting back with you on your suggestion.  Nothing moves fast in the world of bankruptcy.  Before I left to go out of the country we had put together a proposal to the bankruptcy court to buy computers -- per Donna's note below the bankruptcy court hasn't acted on it yet.  I'll let you know if I hear of any opportunity for employees to buy computers.

Laptops and computers are not an option at this time.  The bankrupcy committee has not released them to sell due to their contents.  To date, we have only been able to secure flat screens.  We are still waiting to hear if employees can purchase flat screens, I assume you are still interested.  The committee has pushed the hardware liquidation topic back to the end of January.  We'll keep you posted.

	Unfortunately I will be on vacation on November 26th.  However, Gary will be attending and is well versed and postured to speak to 16 and 31 day charted PD measurement.  Gary has been working behind the scenes with your group, the field, marketing and technology to resolve the problems associated with equipment not suited for providing adequate daily information.  At the same time he has been working on gaining assistance in getting 16 day measurement data into the office on time for processing and review prior to month's end close.   Just as a side note, I understand now that Charlie Thompson of the Measurement Technology Group and Tech Ops has been given the charge to come up with a five year plan for installing automated and adequate equipment accross the board for these situations.

Ellis/Gary

I hope that you can both make it to the meeting on Monday to discuss the issue of daily NNG measurement readings.  A number of our NNG customers are protesting DDVC invoices based on our inability to provide daily measurement information.   Alliant is just the latest in the string of customers.   The NNG marketing group is very frustrated on this issue.  

We need to put all our collective talents together.  This issue needs the highest levels of attention possible from measurement.

Catherine,

I have received the call and will be traveling to Kazakhstan next week to complete the adoption.  My husband and son are staying back.  I arrive in Almaty on the 14th late in the evening.   I'll spend the day of the 15th in Almaty and then take the overnight train to Taraz.  I expect to have a court date in Taraz on the 19th or 20th.  Then I will be back in Almaty, probably over Christmas.  Finally, I expect to travel to Moscow on around Dec 27 and then return to Houston around Dec 30.  This of course is the plan if everything goes exactly on schedule -- which it probably won't.

I will certainly miss being away from home at Christmas and am hoping to find a Christmas worship service in Almaty.   I'd appreciate any advice in this regard.

I would also appreciate advice on what time of clothes are appropriate to bring.

Thanks
Shelley Corman

Shelley, Alma coordinates the pager activity for most of the people in the group, but yours is not one of them.  Would you like Alma to track down the person at Skytel to return your pager to or would you prefer she just hand it over to Ricki?  We do not want to continue to pay for your pager now that you have a blackberry.

Is the activity at the MidLouisiana points normal.  How did we build up a 156,000 MMBtu balance at Port Hudson.  Is this a measurement or a scheduling mismatch?  How big is this point?

Sarah,

Attached is TW revenue detail by contract for the years 1997-2000.   At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date.  

For example, for calendar year 1997:
Short-term  = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98  + all IT & PNR revenues
Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond.


Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000.

Call me at x37083 if you have questions.

Shelley,
 
We will need to change the address and then get it all signed again.  It is good to know that the study overall meets their requirements.  This is probably going to take a few more days.  Still, it is better to have all of this taken care of now than to have someone send the study back.
 
Sorry for the delay.

Dear Suzanne, 
I reviewed the homestudy you emailed to Ginger and it looks good.Please 
change the address for Across the World to :399 Taylor Boulevard,Suite 
102, 
Pleasant Hill, California 94523.That is the address for the main office in 
Calif. I did notice that MARITAL was spelled marial in the marital 
section. 
I'm sure your spellcheck probably caught it.I noticed that you mentioned 
the" Republic of Kazakhstan" quite a few times. I'm not sure if that is 
the 
correct name of the country. I will check and let you know if you need to 
change it.There is only one other thing that needs to be changed .It is 
located about the last paragraph of recommendation where you state that 
"the 
family is excited to experience the Russian culture".That statement would 
be 
very offensive to the Kazakhstan officials if you were to mention Russian 
culture. These people are not part of Russia-they are Kazakhstani- and a 
very proud people.So you could just change the word Russian to Kazakhstan. 
They do not like to be referred to as Russian.Let me know if you have any 
questions. I left you a message to call me but I don't think you need to 
call back unless you have questions. Please make sure that there is a 
current agency license at the back of the homestudy when the family sends 
their homestudy to me. I will be the one helping Ginger go thru everything 
so if you have questions feel free to call Ginger or me. 
Chris

In your e-mail, please indicate the number of seats you're interested in purchasing for the full season (no partial season or individual games).

I'm not sure Sheila is the one for sign off.
Also, I'm not sure we have our act together.
We need to do that before the draft goes out.
I am especially concerned about the suggested tolerances.
Given our recent discussions, they may be too low.
If anything, it seems like they are less then the recent Shelley/Mike guidelines.
(Maybe we need some more "official" guidelines.)
If Trunkline sees these numbers, it may be hard to change the tolerances.
Finally, Shelley and Mike may be concerned if we sent it out without their comments.
I will continue to press for input.

Q,

Cindy told me that they are still in the same class with Chad and don't test
until Thursday.  Therefore, Cindy will pick up Chad tonight and Wednesday if
we decide Chad is going Wednesday,  Based on that, I think I'll run tonight.

See you when you get home.

Love Kim

Ann,

Per Rod Hayslett, you are able to process changes to list B to accommodate instances in which Dynegy & ETS can agree on the specific assignment of an individual.

Craig Buehler and Esther DaSilva are both currently company 179 employees.  We moved both of these individuals to list C because we anticipated that one of the two might need to stay to support deal capture/contracts/data requests for TW.  Craig Buehler has subsequently indicated his plans to leave the company if he is not assigned to list B.  Dave Neubauer has requested that Craig be moved to list B and both Rick Dietz (Craig's immediate supervisor) and I are in agreement.  And, if we agree to move Craig to list B, we need to make the same accommodation for Esther DaSilva.  Dave Neubauer is in agreement with this revision as well.  

Accordingly, please move Craig Buehler and Esther DaSilva from List C to List B.

FYI - we will use another contract position vacancy to cover TW deal capture/contracts/data requests if deemed necessary.

Thanks
Shelley

Can they come in the afternoon on Feb 18 (President's Day)?  I have an appointment with the tax lady in the AM.

Can you see about getting Alina a Dentist appointment on Mar 1 at 8 AM  (or at 1 PM) ?  Is it time for Chad to have an appointment again?  Chad has off school on Mar 1 & I plan to take a vacation day.  Alina has an appointment for more vaccinations with Dr Kline at 10 AM.  We may go to the zoo after that.

Okay sounds like we are the first Taraz group and the Almaty group is before us.  That is the group that she said is not traveling until Nov. 15.  Sergei is the guide to both the Almaty group and to us.    

I am so much praying that we will be home before Dec. 15. On that date my nanny returns to Bolivia for Christmas and I will be lacking childcare for Chad at home.  Wow this waiting is stressful.

Based on current est. travel times, I think that we will both travel over.  Kim will probably be the one to stay the two weeks, so that I can come home to tend to Chad & his obligations.   We definitely don't want to leave Alina to come with an escort.  But, the issue we still need to work through is the fact that Alina is still scared o Kim.

Ginger,
I was able to get Ginger on her cell phone. She said, that we were the first 
to go in, that the other group was a different region, and that they had to 
go in order and that their paper work was in before ours. She said she was 
not sure what Chris had told me, but would get with her about it when she 
gets back. I do NOT like it all, but will try to give them the benefit of the 
doubt that this is the best that can be done.

I also asked about the 2 weeks prior to court date, and the 2 weeks after 
court date, and she said as of now only the 2 weeks prior is being waived, 
but that Sergei is still working on it and will not have the answer until he 
has our court date and papers.
I also asked (again) about only 1 parent travelling and she said that to her 
knowledge there has been no law change to allow that, and I asked (again) 
what about a waiver or something and she did say they have been asking that 
question of Kazakhstan but no answer yet.

There is the option of having your child escorted back by future family, 
Ginger didn't think I would want to do that, and she is right, but I guess it 
is an option.

Well, at least we for sure will be able to do the conference.

Joceyln,

I've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person.  I deposited the Enron check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office.

Unless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith Barney and put the caption FBO Shelley Corman in the Memo line of check.  Let me know if an account number should appear on the check.

I'll gladly bring my photo album and Alina.  Chad has a playdate at a neighbors house.

Gaby told me that she cannot attend.

You mentioned that several people may come to the get together late and that we may visit longer than 12:30 pm.  My sister is arriving in town for a visit around 12PM and a cab is picking her up at the airport.  I currently have arrangements for the cab driver to take her to my house (probably around 1 PM). Let me know if you think I should change this arrangement.   

I can't think of anyone we missed for the party, except Bobby Oldfield.  She is going to start working with us on Children's Church and was a fantastic help with VBS.  I inadvertently dropped her name from the list.  

Thank you for everything you do.  I'm always overwhelmed by your kindness.

Shelley

Hi Shelley:
I am looking forward to seeing you and Alina tomorrow for the shower.  It 
will be great to have the opportunity to visit with you.
Just so you know, Laura and Kathryn will be here tomorrow and can help 
entertain Alina if needed.
There are several people that I have not heard from as far as RSVP's.  We 
will have plenty of food, so if anyone asks you, please tell them just to 
come!
Take care,
Barbara
P.S.  By the way, if you have any pictures or mementos from your trip that 
you might like to share, bring them along.

I, on behalf of Infinite Energy, would like to offer my deepest sympathies to Richard Blaser, Executive Vice President of Infinite Energy, and his family.  Richard's parents were in a plane crash this past weekend.    
 
Russ and Carol Blaser were celebrating a friend's 40th birthday with his wife by eating out in Cedar Key, Florida.  They flew out to Cedar Key and were intending to fly back to Gainesville after the celebratory dinner.  Russ Blaser was an accomplished and experienced pilot and in fact had participated in many air shows with his stunt plane.   
 
Shortly after takeoff from Cedar Key, the plane Russ was flying crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Richard's mom was killed and his father has not yet been found. 
 
The date for the funeral of Carol Blaser has not yet been set.  I will relay any relevant information regarding funeral arrangements and Russ Blaser's status to those on this email list as they become available.  
 
Please take a moment to think of Rich and his family.
 
Darin

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=
w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =
price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=
 energy-trading companies.=20
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=
ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=
h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=
on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=
raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=
ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =
the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=
actions.
"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch an=
alyst Donato Eassey. "There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=
Online." As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =
which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =
operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=
tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=
old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=
 intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=
h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=
ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=
ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=
tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=
ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=
ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=
 of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=
 analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=
ctions.=20
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=
 the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=
gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. "In my continue=
d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=
oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Ch=
airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company." He =
couldn't be reached for comment.=20
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=
ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=
 close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=
16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=
arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=
e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=
, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =
stock.=20
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =
this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=
 which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=
ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=
ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=
h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=
ed investment vehicles.=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=
 be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns. H=
owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=
s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admissi=
on of guilt." Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=
gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=
al structure.=20
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=
.=20
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=
tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =
people voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing c=
redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=
o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=
ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =
has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=
ce of such a problem.=20
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=
 its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=
ntities. Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility. It's not ea=
sy to regain something as basic as trust," he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=
idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=
se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=
y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=
 to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =
as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =
a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=
vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=
 the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =
named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=
s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=
=20
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=
ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=
nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=
 reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=
th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=
s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=
llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=
 write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=
en they later learned about it.=20
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=
lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=
 transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=
 Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=
ls of the transactions.=20
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=
 disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=
.=20
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =
stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=
ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=
 that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =
S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=
o address.=20
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=
 complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=
f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=
n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=
d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=
dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=
ere more than adequate.=20
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=
he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=
siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=
rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=
ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=
 successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=
s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=
hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=
ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=
g, they fell to $16.14.=20
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=
 Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=
 from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=
ay.=20
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=
day evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=
 a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=
 little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=
=20
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=
ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=
t any answers.''

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-ba=
sed Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal s=
ecurities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investm=
ent partnerships that he ran.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andr=
ew Fastow had been put on a "leave of absence" for an undetermined period a=
nd named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The com=
pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=
one anything improper.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =
market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=
, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=
er earnings on Oct 16.=20
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=
sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=
n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=
 LJM2 Co-Investment.=20
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=
 served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =
Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=
nded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=
on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=
 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=
llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=
 in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a "Chinese wall" existed be=
tween Enron and LJM.=20
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=
e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=
he company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=
 asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=
le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=
or comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=
 a salary.=20
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "=
informal inquiry" into the LJM dealings.=20
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =
confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=
r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=
ling in August for personal reasons.=20
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=
d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=
ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=
 analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=
rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =
issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=
es.=20
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=
utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=
 be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=
=20
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=
6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=
.=20
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=
ompanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, whi=
ch closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some=
 way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with an=
alysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.=20
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston=
, moved from a "hold" to a "sell" rating.=20

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company =
attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia=
l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which =
has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed =
that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr =
Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=
erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=
re may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October=
 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =
charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=
 partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=
onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =
Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=
er served as Enron's treasurer.=20
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=
 Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=
strating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=
r Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =
calls.=20
Ms Coale issued a "sell" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=
 to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. "We are concerned abou=
t what we don't know," Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might ha=
ve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=
ced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose cus=
tomers to competitors that were not under such pressure.=20
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove t=
he company has done nothing wrong. Lex, Page 16.=20

Shares in Enron, the US energy group, fell again yesterday after Prudential=
 Securities issued a "sell" note on concerns that the $1.2bn loss taken by =
the company last week might not be the end of its bad news.=20
In the first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading, Enron's stock was the=
 biggest percentage loser, dropping 20.2 per cent to $15.80 - its lowest le=
vel since August 1995. /
"We are concerned about what we don't know," said Carol Coale, the Prudenti=
al analyst who covers Enron.=20
She was disappointed that Enron had not been more forthcoming in the confer=
ence call it held on Tuesday in response to charges it was not being transp=
arent.=20
Investors have been abandoning the stock since October 16, when Enron told =
analysts it was taking a $1.2bn loss in shutting down funding mechanisms it=
 had set up in controversial partnerships established with Andrew Fastow, t=
he chief financial officer.=20
This charge has not been thoroughly explained, leading to confusion among a=
nalysts and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission=
.=20
Ms Coale said she was concerned Enron might have to sell assets below book =
value to maintain its credit rating, or be forced to issue equity to bolste=
r its balance sheet. She said Enron might lose customers to competitors tha=
t are not under such pressure.=20
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and that the SEC enquiry will pr=
ove that the company has done nothing wrong.=20

Enron=20
To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chie=
f financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in i=
ts third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1=
.2bn equity charge related to the closing of "related party transactions" w=
ith two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention t=
hat the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest a=
nyone?=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. I=
nvestors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so af=
ter its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the =
financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposit=
e effect.=20
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes rece=
ivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination=
 of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. Th=
e uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock=
 to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack o=
f disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlike=
ly to lose its investment grade status, but dilution is a real risk for sha=
reholders. Mr Fastow has gone (following Jeffrey Skilling, former chief exe=
cutive, who quit after only six months as CEO). But the credibility problem=
 goes beyond one individual.=20

Enron Corp. Cut to `Market Perform' at Banc of America
2001-10-25 08:49 (New York)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg Data) -- Enron Corp. (ENE US=
)
was downgraded to ``market perform'' from ``strong buy'' by analyst William=
 J
Maze at Banc of America.


Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions
By PAM EASTON

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inve=
stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c=
ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha=
nge Commission inquiry.=20
"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer=
n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of =
the SEC," Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. "W=
ho knows?"
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after =
the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Mon=
day's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu=
siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed=
 Wednesday.=20
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, wh=
o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets =
group, takes over his role.=20
"I think change is good at this particular point in time," said FAC Equitie=
s analyst Robert Christensen said. "I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."=
=20
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than=
 replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi=
ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.=20
"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe=
w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements," Heim s=
aid.=20
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.=20
"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans=
parent to the financial community," Heim said. "Instead of being more trans=
parent there is more confusion than ever."=20
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 =
per share, a 17 percent decline.=20
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week,=
 Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.=20
"The market was asking for that to happen," J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg=
in said of Fastow's departure. "This is really the first time Enron has act=
ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis."=20
Previously, Enron's managers have been "cautious and defensive in their app=
roach," he said.=20
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the =
partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl=
ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have sin=
ce been dissolved.=20
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.=20
"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or=
 here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever=
 expect to take any more charges," Heim said. "What I heard is we don't hav=
e to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed."=20
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third qu=
arter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive of=
ficer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's fut=
ure, Heim said.=20
"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company be=
ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro=
m now, two years from now," he said.=20
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, F=
eygin said.=20
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow =
before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused =
McMahon to leave his job as treasurer.=20
"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the=
 partnerships)," Feygin said. "Three days ago I would have said there is no=
 need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was so=
mething Enron needed to do."

Enron fires CFO to quell unrest: Stock meltdown

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief=
 financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble.=20
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conferen=
ce call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial of=
ficer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasure=
r Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. Th=
e stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion o=
f shareholder wealth.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.=20
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, result=
ing from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.=20
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity=
 for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to=
 a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow.=20
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of =
growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently look=
ing into the partnership arrangement.=20
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conferenc=
e call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors.=20
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in t=
he partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsu=
it filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties=
 by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships.=20
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol =
Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this=
 week, to "sell" from "hold." Ms. Coale said the rating change is "not beca=
use of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't kn=
ow about the company."=20
Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average dai=
ly volume is 6.7 million shares.=20
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's=
 line during the conference call.=20
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chi=
ef financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder eq=
uity. But Mr. Feygin said management was "defensive" when pressed for detai=
ls.=20
Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad=
 news was to come.=20
While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the compa=
ny's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term f=
ortunes.=20
Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the compan=
y's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's l=
owered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.

HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it named Jeff McMahon chief financial offic=
er in place of Andrew Fastow.=20
Announcing McMahon's appointment, Chairman Kenneth Lay said: "In my continu=
ed discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that res=
toring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial =
transactions made with the two LJM partnerships run by Fastow, which analys=

uits against the company.=20
On Monday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was =
looking into the Fastow-related transactions.=20
McMahon had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets =
group.=20
The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter as saying Mc=
Mahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the=
 company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships.=20
Internal documents indicate Fastow and possibly a handful of associates mad=
e millions of dollars from the partnerships, the newspaper reported.=20

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow Wednesd=
ay amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into partnerships he r=
an that cost the largest energy trader $35 million.=20
Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets group, as CFO beca=
use "it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require=
 us to replace Andy," Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said.
Fastow will take a leave of absence.=20
Shares of Enron, based in Houston, have plunged 80% this year. Third-quarte=
r charges of $1.01 billion from failed investments outside the main commodi=
ties trading business wiped out 70% of the profit earned in the last four q=
uarters.=20
"Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to Andy," said J.P. M=
organ analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded Enron to "long-term buy" and ow=
ns no shares.=20
Fastow, 39, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, two partnerships created=
 by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's involvement in the financing vehic=
les cost the company $35 million in third-quarter losses.=20
Enron also bought back 62 million shares from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billio=
n to unwind its investment.=20
During a conference call Tuesday, Lay said, "I and Enron's board of directo=
rs continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy and think he's=
 doing an outstanding job as CFO."=20
Enron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock closed down $3.38, =
or 17%, to $16.41 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, sett=
ing a new 52-week low.=20
The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday. Spokeswoman Kare=
n Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron is cooperating with, and =
that no subpoenas have been received.=20
The company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships and corporations=
, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants, records at =
the Texas secretary of state's office indicate.

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with =
Andrew Fastow.=20
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the e=
xecutive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, =
saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this dea=
l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=
sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=
 once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =
once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=
ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=
astow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =
formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=
lleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=
 show that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=
ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=
 about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =
Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=
y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=
n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=
t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=
k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=
 difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=
ing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=
er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=
rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=
he company?=20
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=
 Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=
essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=
owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=
siness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=
ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=
he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=
band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=
rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=
 that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=
ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=
he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=
sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=
 not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =
Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=
 on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =
has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=
nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =
spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=
arency.=20
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=
r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20

Did Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) cause the energy crisis? Did it cr=
eate a short squeeze in energy by buying up all available power and hoardin=
g it, perhaps in a series of partnerships that it controlled? Did we wipe o=
ut billions in equity of utilities in some sort of bizarre zero-sum game in=
 which Enron won it all and shareholders from California utilities lost?=20
And was Enron at the hub of a vast power conspiracy to screw the U.S. consu=
mer?=20
Somehow, I believe that if it weren't for the events of Sept. 11 and its af=
termath, these questions would be asked right now by a Justice Department a=
ntitrust division or a Congressional investigation. To me, this one smells =
worse than anything that Microsoft might have done at one time.=20
And we need to give some of these departed Enron execs immunity to get to t=
he bottom of what may have been the greatest antitrust act in history.=20
We ought to do it fast, too, while there is some Enron left to pay the treb=
le damages that violators owe.=20
What surprises me is that some enterprising young prosecutor doesn't want t=
o make his name blowing this one wide open.=20
This nation must stop at nothing to get the terrorists. But it can't abando=
n the white-collar folks, either.=20
There was just too much money lost too fast for what, in an era where energ=
y seems pretty plentiful, couldn't possibly, in retrospect, be considered a=
 real shortage.=20

 ???Small-Stock Focus: Russell 2000 Ekes Out Increase; Adtran, Arris Group =

Journal?C6?(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)??NEW YORK -- It =
was a day for small-cap stocks to hug the baseline -- barely moving -- befo=
re ending the day with a slight gain as a number of positive profit reports=
 pitched them onto positive ground. ?The Russell 2000 Index of small-capita=
lization stocks rose 0.28 point, or 0.07%, to 427.65, while the Nasdaq Comp=
osite Index added 27.10, or 1.59%, to 1731.54.?Given small caps' modest adv=
ance, their finishing the day higher hardly was guaranteed. For a while, in=
 fact, they trailed larger-cap technology issues and blue chips, although t=
here were moments when these stocks, too, slipped into negative territory. =
?The day offered little anthrax news but lots of earnings reports, and inve=
stors voted according to whether their companies had done well or not. ?Gen=
erally for small caps, "It's `where do we go from here' time," said Andrew =
Rich, small-cap portfolio manager with Driehaus Capital Management. A lot o=
f small caps have recouped the ground they lost the first week the market r=
eopened after the terrorist attacks, but there are few compelling reasons t=
o be an aggressive buyer, Mr. Rich said. "Now, it seems the whole market is=
 looking for direction." ?On the Nasdaq, volume was 1.865 billion shares, w=
ith 1.321 billion advancing and 516 million declining. Gainers outpaced dec=
liners by 1,902 to 1,628. ?It was tech all the way among the day's top perf=
ormers. ?Communications technology, including a lot of fiber-optic and netw=
orking firms, ranked highest. Among small caps, Adtran rose 97 cents, or 4.=
2%, to 23.97, Arris Group jumped 75 cents, or 19%, to 4.60 and Extreme Netw=
orks added 93 cents, or 7.6%, to 13.17. ?Semiconductors were the session's =
second-best presenters with, among small caps, Elantec Semiconductor adding=
 3.71, or 12%, to 34.15, and Oak Technology rising 86 cents, or 11%, to 8.8=
0. ?Wireless-communications stocks were also strong, with help from large-c=
ap Nextel Communications, which advanced 1.29, or 17%, to 8.69 after postin=
g a third-quarter loss that surpassed Wall Street estimates amid continued =
firmness in subscriber growth. In some possible spillover among small caps,=
 AirGate PCS rose 3.28, or 6.1%, to 56.78. ?The day's poorest performers we=
re natural-gas utilities, which continued to be dragged down by large cap E=
nron, which fell 3.38, or 17%, to 16.41. Piedmont Natural Gas fell 34 cents=

Pegasystems jumped 1.21, or 43%, to 4.01 after a 12% rise Tuesday. The Camb=
ridge, Mass., developer of customer-management software enjoyed an even str=
onger second day yesterday, following Tuesday's release of better-than-expe=
cted third-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, beating an analyst's estim=
ate by 10 cents a share. ?Pinnacle Systems rose 83 cents, or 25%, to 4.20. =
The Mountain View, Calif., video-production-system maker had a fiscal first=

at a discount to Tuesday's close of 26.80. ?Merger activity had a positive =
effect on small caps. PRI Automation jumped 3.38, or 27%, to 15.92. The Bil=

g-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grade=
s of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.?"=
It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Director=
s have not had the scrutiny they deserve," said Ms. Minow, who said the ser=
vice will be called Board Analyst. ?Planned as an added feature on an exist=
ing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing st=
ages but is expected to launch next year, she said. ?Only directors of U.S.=
 companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added lat=
er. ?Ms. Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corpo=
rate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washingto=
n-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to Britis=
h fund management group Hermes. ?Their latest venture may find a receptive =
audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. ?"Ther=
e's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in gen=
eral, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there wou=
ld be interest in more information on individual directors," said Ann Yerge=
r, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents=
 America's large pension funds. ?The corporate governance movement, since i=
ts beginnings in the 1970s, has focused on making directors more accountabl=
e and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside =
directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples=
 of lax board oversight still abound. ?One example would be Enron Corp., wh=
ose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities =
and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain ou=
tside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Ms. Minow sai=
d. ?"Where was the Enron board in all of this?" she asked. "Boards and outs=
ide consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That=
 apparently didn't happen here." ?Taking the corporate governance argument =
a step further, Ms. Minow argued that effective board membership is more th=
an a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate =
when they consider buying stock in a company. ?"This isn't just a corporate=
 governance thing. This is part of investment analysis," she said. ?Institu=
tional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stoc=
ks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open=
 question. ?"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long =
time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction," said Pet=
er Gleason, vice-president of research and development at the National Asso=
ciation of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate =
directors. ?Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate direc=
tors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. "More and more di=
rectors are saying this is something we should be doing," Mr. Gleason said.=

e of confidence ?CBSMarketWatch.com?Lisa Sanders?10/24/01?NEW YORK (CBS.MW)=
 - One day after issuing a public vote of confidence in his chief financial=
 officer, Enron Chief Executive Ken Lay ousted him Wednesday in the latest =
in a two-week series of events that have caused Enron shares to more than h=
alve.?Enron named Jeff McMahon its new chief financial officer Wednesday, r=
eplacing Andy Fastow. The move follows Tuesday's conference call, which was=
 an attempt by Enron to restore investor confidence in the company.?"Andy F=
astow was a very well-regarded, low profile individual at Enron, and he's b=
een unfairly pilloried in the press," said John Olson, an analyst at Sander=
s Morris Harris in Houston. "But the weight of circumstantial evidence and =
the material stock price decline made this inevitable."?Olson predicted the=
 CFO swap would improve Enron's credibility with Wall Street.?A rough week?=
Enron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about =
its accounting practices, especially in regard to two limited partnerships =
created by Fastow in 1999 and since dissolved. ?Enron said Fastow had taken=
 a leave of absence and that McMahon, most recently chairman and CEO of the=
 industrial markets group and treasurer from 1998 to 2000, would take over.=
?"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=
 to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =
as CFO," said Lay, in a statement.?Karen Denne, a spokesperson for Enron, s=
aid numerous discussions Tuesday and Wednesday led to the decision. She sai=
d she did not know when Fastow would return. ?Shares of Enron fell more tha=
n 17 percent Wednesday to $16.41, then fell further in late trading followi=
ng the announcement, to as low as $16.18. At one point during the trading d=
ay, the shares were trading at a six-year low of $15.51. ?Analysts deliver =
blows?Olson called Tuesday's conference call a "missed opportunity," saying=
 Enron had a real opportunity to show the investing public that it had beco=
me more "forthright and open."?"Unfortunately Enron is overloaded with lawy=
ers," said Olson, who has not recommended the stock until recently. "This c=
ompany has been very much abused and maligned by people on Wall Street. The=
y have some excellent businesses, and they have been carrying some losers."=
 Enron has "an excellent growth profile and tremendous profitability in the=
ir growth businesses, and excellent surplus cash flow," Olson said.?Enron e=
xpects to generate $3 billion of cash flow this year, and with $500 million=
 devoted to dividends and $1 billion to maintenance capital spending, the c=
ompany will have $1.5 billion free.?Several Wall Street firms cut their rat=
ings on Enron shares Wednesday, including Prudential Securities. The firm a=
dvised clients to sell the stock, a rare recommendation. Prudential had rat=
ed the company's shares a "hold." ?"After much consideration, we are loweri=
ng our rating ... not because of things we know but because of things we po=
tentially don't know about the company," wrote Prudential analyst Carol Coa=
le in a note. ?On Monday, Enron announced that related-party transactions w=
ithin the limited partnerships are under review by the Securities and Excha=
nge Commission. Several shareholder lawsuits have subsequently been filed.?=
"Management used the SEC inquiry as a shield to avoid elaboration on the is=
sue at hand, the LJM transactions," Coale said in reference to the conferen=
ce call. ?Olson said it's unlikely that Enron, with its coterie of lawyers,=
 would allow the creation of illegal investment vehicles, but as to whether=
 it was "right," he conceded it was probably not.?J.P. Morgan's Anatol Feyg=
in downgraded his rating to "long-term buy" from "buy," saying an upgrade i=
s precluded until the company provides more information about its liabiliti=
es. ?"Management's conference call yesterday was a missed opportunity to di=
sclose the necessary information to assuage investor concerns," Feygin wrot=
e. ?Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey noted Wednesday that if Enron isn't=
 able to maintain its investment-grade ratings -- the company's debt is on =
watch for a potential downgrade by Moody's Investors Service -- issuing new=
 equity would be one course of action, though with the potential to reduce =
earnings-per-share. Enron on Tuesday held with its forecast of $1.80 a shar=
e for 2001. ?"New equity would potentially dilute our EPS estimates 5 to 10=
 percent," Eassey wrote in a follow-up to the conference call. ?But Eassey =
believes that cash flow from operations -- expected to exceed $3 billion in=
 2002 -- along with asset sales, should be enough to "insulate" the company=

Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , trying to halt a freefall in its stock pri=
ce and a firestorm of criticism from Wall Street, named a new chief financi=
al officer on Wednesday to replace Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to tr=
ansactions now under investigation by government regulators. ?The company, =
which is the nation's largest energy trader, said Fastow would take a leave=
 of absence and be replaced by Jeff McMahon, who has been running an Enron =
unit and is the company's former treasurer, in a bid to restore credibility=
 with investors.?Fastow's departure follows the August resignation of chief=
 executive Jeff Skilling, who said he wanted a change in lifestyle after ju=
st six months on the job. ?Wednesday's change came after Enron's stock fell=
 $3.38 to $16.41, its lowest point in six years, to cap off a $13 billion p=
lunge in market value since the company announced a third quarter loss last=
 week and wrote down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in a move related t=
o the questionable transactions. ?Wall Street's anxieties about Enron sprea=
d to the stocks of other natural gas and power traders and marketers on Wed=
nesday, with Dynegy Inc. falling 12.8 percent to $37.26 and Aquila Inc. off=
 11.7 percent at $21.20. ?Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves follo=
wing disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions wi=
th two limited partnerships run by Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and =
Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. =
?Wall Street analysts who once touted the company have bitterly accused it =
of not being forthcoming about the matter, a problem Enron chief executive =
Ken Lay cited in his appointment of McMahon. ?"In my continued discussions =
with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor=
 confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," he said in a statemen=
t. ?McMahon, who was treasurer from 1998 to 2000 before becoming chief exec=
utive officer of Enron's Industrial Markets group, has a "deep and thorough=
 understanding of Enron" and the confidence of the investment world, Lay sa=
id. ?The Wall Street Journal reported that it was McMahon who first spoke u=
p about the perception of impropriety in the limited partnership arrangemen=
ts made by Fastow. The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it=
, which led McMahon, 40, to ask for a job change. ?Fastow has denied any wr=
ongdoing, but has been limited in his ability to speak about the issues bec=
ause of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits now pending against =
the company. ?As recently as a year ago, Enron had a stellar image as a cor=
porate innovator with a Midas touch. Its profits and stock price soared as =
it transformed from a natural gas pipeline company to a high-tech money mac=
hine creating new Internet-based trading markets in a wide range of commodi=
ties. ?But some of its new businesses faded, a large investment in an India=
n power plant went sour, the California power crises spooked investors, and=
 then Skilling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation.=
 ?There also was grousing from investors that Enron's earnings statements h=
ad become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility. ?Analysts said th=
e replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction for Enron, but no=
t a panacea for its credibility problems. ?"The problems investors are havi=
ng with Enron are related to a lack of understanding of all these partnersh=
ip arrangements. Changing the CFO by itself doesn't really address those co=
ncerns," said Mike Heim at A.G. Edwards. ?"I don't think anyone has a full =
understanding of the extent of the liabilities Enron might have with these =
partnerships," he said. "I still have a lot of questions." ?Andre Meade at =
Commerzbank Securities said Fastow's departure was not unexpected, but not =
that helpful. ?"Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that cle=
ars up the picture," he said. "Frankly, Ken Lay and the board don't have cl=
ean hands when it comes to these transactions." ?"The fear driving the mark=
et is: if this is what we know, how much worse can it get?" said J.P. Morga=

??NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Slipping expectations of 2002 power profits =
combined with Enron Corp.'s growing problems helped drag utility stock pric=
es to their lowest levels this month on Wednesday. ?While the general marke=
t closed higher, the S&P Utilities Index ended the day with a loss of 8.99,=
 or 3.55 percent, to 244.32.?The big loser, as it has been in many recent s=
essions, was Enron, which traded at the lowest price since February 1995 be=
fore steadying a bit to close at $16.41 - down 17.08 percent, or $3.38, for=
 the day and 44 percent from its price two weeks ago - as analysts recommen=
ded selling the stock. ?Prudential's Carol Coale said the sell recommendati=
on was not made "because of things that we know, but because of things we p=

of lower estimates of 2002 earnings from power production and trading came =
from four companies active in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest - American Ele=
ctric Power Co. Inc. , Exelon Corp. , Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. =
and PPL Corp. . ?Early Wednesday, PPL said it now sees little, if any, chan=
ge in earnings per share next year from this year, citing expectations of l=
ower profits on power sales in Maine, Pennsylvania and Montana. The company=
 also confirmed it still sees 2001 earnings exceeding $4.00 per share. ?Not=
ing PPL's previous 2002 guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share, Wachovia Sec=
urities analyst Thomas Hamlin lowered the stock's rating to "market perform=
" from "strong buy" explaining PPL's "failure to differentiate itself from =
the power producing price takers has hurt management's credibility. ?"The c=
ompany will need to prove its risk management capabilities in order to be a=
fforded a multiple in line with our higher rated Merchant Power stocks," he=
 concluded. ?Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Lehman Brothers made similar dow=
ngrades in Exelon after its first 2002 guidance trailed analyst expectation=
s. ?STOCK LOSSES FOLLOW OUTLOOK CHANGES ?"The primary driver (for the 2002 =
estimate) is lower wholesale commodity price assumptions at (the company's =
generation unit), in addition to weaker distribution demand" at Exelon's ut=
ility subsidiaries in Philadelphia and Chicago, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown a=
nalyst James Dobson wrote Tuesday. ?Exelon officials noted, in answer to an=
alyst questions, that the view of 2002 demand had changed to negative from =
flat since the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. ?The company's st=
ock, which opened 10 percent lower - at $40 - following the earnings releas=
e early Tuesday steadied to close at $41.80. The shares continued to advanc=
e Wednesday when its 12-cent rise made it one of four gainers among the 40 =
S&P Utility Index components. ?The big loser among the integrated utilities=
 - those which produce and distribute power - was PPL, which ended the day =
at $32 - down $1.68, or 4.99 percent. ?Losses of about 1.3 percent were pos=
ted by AEP, which closed at $42.59, down 55 cents for the day, and PSEG, wh=

 economy may make the upper end (of its 2002 earnings guidance of $3.80 to =
$3.90) more difficult to achieve," Lehman Brothers analyst Daniel Ford wrot=

2002 earnings per share 5 cents to $4.05 while awaiting the closing of a Pe=

ph.)??     Houston, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief?Financi=
al Officer Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange?Commission inquiry =
into partnerships he ran that cost the largest?energy trader $35 million.??=
     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets?group, as CFO=
 because ``it became clear to me that restoring?investor confidence would r=
equire us to replace Andy,'' Chairman?and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth L=
ay said in a statement.?Fastow will take a leave of absence.??     Shares o=
f Enron, based in Houston, have fallen 80 percent?this year. Third-quarter =
losses of $1.01 billion from failed?investments outside the main commoditie=
s trading business wiped?out 70 percent of the profit earned in the past fo=
ur quarters.??     ``Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure t=
o?Andy,'' said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded?Enron to `=
`long-term buy'' today and owns no shares.??     As Enron treasurer, McMaho=
n complained to then-Enron?President Jeffrey Skilling about potential confl=
icts of interest?posed by the Fastow partnerships in 1999, the Wall Street =
Journal?reported yesterday. Rebuffed, McMahon secured a reassignment, the?J=
ournal said, citing people familiar with the matter.??     ``McMahon was ma=
de famous under Skilling by going to him and?objecting to the partnerships,=
'' Feygin said. ``For that, he was?transferred out of the treasurer functio=
n into Enron Net Works,''?which oversees Enron's Internet trading system.??=
                       `An Outstanding Job'??     Fastow, 39 years old, ran=
 LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,?two partnerships created by Enron to bu=
y company assets. Enron's?involvement in the financing vehicles cost the co=
mpany $35 million?in third-quarter losses. Enron also bought back 62 millio=
n shares?from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment.??   =
  On a conference call yesterday, Lay said that ``I and Enron's?board of di=
rectors continue to have the highest faith and?confidence in Andy and think=
 he's doing an outstanding job as?CFO.''??      Enron announced that Fastow=
 would leave after its stock?closed down $3.38, or 17 percent, to $16.41 in=
 today's trading.??      The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships=
 Monday.?Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron?=
is cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received.??     The co=
mpany has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships?and corporations, some=
 of which buy and sell Enron assets such as?power plants, records at the Te=
xas secretary of state's office?indicate.??     The Texas records list doze=
ns of Enron executives as officers?and directors of company-related partner=
ships. None of them have?any financial interest in the partnerships after F=
astow severed?ties to the LJM partnerships in July, Palmer said.??         =
               `Zero Compensation'??     ``The managers in these affiliates=
 listed as managing members?are representational in nature only,'' he said.=
 ``They get zero?compensation.''??     The LJM partnerships were different.=
 Enron's board allowed?Fastow, who has worked for the company for 11 years,=
 to run them?and earn as much as 2 percent annually on the amounts invested=
,?the Wall Street Journal reported last week. A lawsuit filed by a?sharehol=
der objecting to the arrangement said the partnerships?reworked an agreemen=
t with Enron to avoid taking big losses.??     Enron is obligated to repay =
$3.3 billion associated with two?other partnerships, Marlin and Whitewing, =
if they can't raise?enough money from asset sales to pay off the balance, E=
nron?spokesman Mark Palmer said. Palmer said ``maybe, maybe not'' when?aske=
d if the partnerships will generate enough cash.??     ``The concern now is=
n't just with the LJM partnership, it's?more with the other partnerships, s=
uch as Osprey and Marlin,''?said A.G. Edwards analyst Mike Heim, who has a =
``hold'' rating on?Enron and owns no shares.??                       High L=

two?years. CEO Skilling resigned in August after seven months on the?job, c=

 U.S.?business, quit August 2000 as chairman and chief executive of?Azurix =

Stan's been invited to present at a broadcast that SGA is hosting.  Apparently, Jerry Halverson indicated to this organization that Stan would be a great person to represent the industry.  Would you both take a look at the agenda for the broadcast and let me know if you think this is something that Stan should participate in?

If it is something that you think is worthwhile, I would work with INGAA on exactly what message they want Stan to communicate.

Thanks for your insight.

Can I get your opinion by Thursday?

Greg,

Typically I sign all these EDI trading partner agreements with Lee Huber's initials.  Can we get the proper agency/delegations in place so that I can continue to sign without further ado so long as the agreements are identical to the GISB standard agreement.  We can put in place a separate procedure for any non-standard TPAs?

You can see the splits between the gallup volumes, red rock and the pre existing deals.   I also need to verify the capacity added from the expansions.   Also need to begin to detail the volumes from Long term firm contract versus short term deals including IT etc.

Rod,

Following our conversations today it appears necessary to include more granular information in the transwestern model.  We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers. 

This information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for "reverse synergies."  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.

I don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.  

Please let me know if you feel the template does not capture the relevant information.  I will be in at 7am tomorrow if you would like to discuss this information.  

Jayshree and I also have additional information requests from our conversations of the last two days, but I will send that information in an e-mail tomorrow.	

Thank you,
Sarah

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,

Ken Lay

Hi Mom,

Chad just loves his apple checkboard.  Thanks again for it.

I am still feeling sick.  Last week my Dr. told me its just allergies/asthma, but I'm still feeling puny.  I trying to get in to see if I have a touch of bronchitis or something.

I'm going to forward this little list while I'm thinking of it.  Ordinarily, I'm not one of those people that believes in giving people a gift wish list.  It seems kind of rude and presumptious.  However, given that we may be traveling in the November-December time frame and unable to field the normal questions I receive about what Mr. Chad is into -- I thought I'd provide this list:

Things Chad Says He Wants for Christmas (That Santa isn't bringing) if anyone asks -- not he should expect to get these items (since some cost more than $20)

-Harry Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows)  (more expensive item)
-Backyard Football Game for Computer (MS-Windows)
-Harry Potter Trading Cards
-Video or DVD of "Cats and Dogs"
-Harry Potter Snapes Potion Kit (More expensive item)
-Ultra Grip Nerf Football

Incidentally, Chad is asking Santa for the Harry Potter Legos Set, a Levitating Game and an Air Snare Drum Game.


More Later

Caroline - I think you captured the right projects, but please look at the bottom line on total reductions.  You show $3 Million in savings.  I think that the schedule should reflect over $6 million of reductions from the original cap. budget.

In my mind there is still a question on whether the meter bounce and PNR projects should be included.

I'd tell her that we have actual tickets for games on Mar 9 (Astros) and Mar 13 (Indians), but otherwise just plan to buy the day of the game.  We just pulled schedules from the web.

My feeling is that once they affirmatively decide they are going to FL, you should say that I rented a house and that you are going to come over and stay with us for a few days.  I know this might push us to the point of her asking whether they can stay with us .... but I'm afraid the kids will spill the beans.

Shelley, I need to make my vacation plans for the Christmas holidays and I don't know how long you will be away.

Since I did not take any vacation during Thanksgiving, I was planning on leaving Thursday December 20th, returning on Monday January 7th.  Jean will be checking my lap top to make sure my dial-in access is stable so I will be able to keep your in basket clean.  During these dates, I could also have your phone forwarded to Ava if you wish.  We can work out the details later, but I need to purchase my ticket today.  

Since there are many things going on during these uncertain times and you need me here, please feel free to say so,,,, I understand completely.

Thank you, Ricki

Okay, I've already had questions about statements in this memo.  My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.

Subject:	UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week


Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Corp Security did a quick audit today of the Gas Control Center on EB42 and made several recommendations of some 
steps we should take prior to some of the expected workforce changes next week.  

1) Tighten control of access to the Gas Control facilities
	- They recommended reducing access to a single door and posting a guard for the next week or so.
	- They recommended reviewing the card access lists for the secure doors and reducing to critical staff only.

	We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South
	hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard
	will be checking everyones card prior to entry. 

	We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and
	IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the	South door.

	We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation
	Center (EB42C1). 

2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone 
	
	We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared 
	to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS. 
	
On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics
business functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections, 
and workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to
support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured
for approximately two weeks, depending on events.

Joceyln,

I've had a change in my schedule today and I won't drop off the check in person.  I deposited the Enron check in my bank account this am on my way to work (to make sure I get the cash before any bankruptcy filing) and will have a personal check couriered over to your office.

Unless you instruct otherwise, I will make the check out to Salomon Smith Barney and put the caption FBO Shelley Corman in the Memo line of check.  Let me know if an account number should appear on the check.

Thanks

Gary -- The biggest problem that I have experienced with emergency employee contact information during Tropical Storm Allison & during recent system outages is that all our contact lists are stored in an intranet environment.  When systems or the Internet are down, we can't get to the contact info.  I am now resorting to keeping a copy of customer contact info stored on a diskette.

 Are there any plans to store a copy of this info on a non-Enron ISP that could be accessed from our Home ISP if the Enron intranet or servers are down?

Subject:	Emergency Response Information

ETS is developing a web-based Emergency Response Information (ERI) system to provide access to employee contact information including work phone, home phone, cell phone, fax number and pager numbers. To facilitate and manage the collection of personal contact data, a new field has been added to eHRonline.

Don,
 
I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.
 
With respect to the specific project listed:
 
1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.
 
 
With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:
 
2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.
 
3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.  
 
 
An additional footnote should be added to the page.
 
4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.

Shelley,
 
We will need to change the address and then get it all signed again.  It is good to know that the study overall meets their requirements.  This is probably going to take a few more days.  Still, it is better to have all of this taken care of now than to have someone send the study back.
 
Sorry for the delay.

Dear Suzanne, 
I reviewed the homestudy you emailed to Ginger and it looks good.Please 
change the address for Across the World to :399 Taylor Boulevard,Suite 
102, 
Pleasant Hill, California 94523.That is the address for the main office in 
Calif. I did notice that MARITAL was spelled marial in the marital 
section. 
I'm sure your spellcheck probably caught it.I noticed that you mentioned 
the" Republic of Kazakhstan" quite a few times. I'm not sure if that is 
the 
correct name of the country. I will check and let you know if you need to 
change it.There is only one other thing that needs to be changed .It is 
located about the last paragraph of recommendation where you state that 
"the 
family is excited to experience the Russian culture".That statement would 
be 
very offensive to the Kazakhstan officials if you were to mention Russian 
culture. These people are not part of Russia-they are Kazakhstani- and a 
very proud people.So you could just change the word Russian to Kazakhstan. 
They do not like to be referred to as Russian.Let me know if you have any 
questions. I left you a message to call me but I don't think you need to 
call back unless you have questions. Please make sure that there is a 
current agency license at the back of the homestudy when the family sends 
their homestudy to me. I will be the one helping Ginger go thru everything 
so if you have questions feel free to call Ginger or me. 
Chris

Today Chris called to tell me that Liz Gras will not be traveling with me and that I should leave on Dec 15 instead of Dec 13 (Tomorrow).   This is all a shock.
I will have to travel by myself.  I have never traveled internationally before and I am a bit scared -- as I'm sure that you were this past summer when you visited.  I know everyone in Kazakhstan will be nice, but I am not looking forward to customs.   I am very excited to see you though.

Depending on how long that I will have to be in Kazakhstan, I may try to come home after court and have Alina escorted to Moscow.  Kim (or Kim & I) may travel to Moscow to pick her up after the New Years holiday.  I will be sad if I have to leave her behind for a few more days.  But I might have to accept this arrangement if my work calls me back to Houston.  So many times my schedule changes that it is difficult at work.  I know that you experienced similar difficulties with you flight plans this summer.

I will bring pictures of your visit this summer.  I will also bring warm clothes!

I received an email from a new family that hopes to adopt Zhuldiz.  I am so happy to hear that she has a family.

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.
"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.
"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."

I love you too.  Thanks for the surprise.  Chad thought we were on a treasure hunt.  He especially loved the special kiss.

They both have the sniffles and I have a sore throat.  Man I don't want to get sick again.

Happy Valentine's Day

Jennie,
 
When you get in tomorrow, could you please check whether the direct flight on the 15th cleared.  If not, please advise which flight path I'm currently cleared on.  
 
I don't want to lose the return home through Moscow on the 31st (waitlisted also for 29th or 30th); but I may also need to return immediately after my court date from Almaty on Dec 23 (in such case my husband would fly back to Moscow to pick up our daughter after the 1st of the year).   I would like to make such a reservation is possible.
 
I think you can probably let all the other waitlisted items go for me.
 
Please call me when you get a chance.
 
Shelley Corman

Unfortunately, with her being a non-employee she will need to get a temp badge everyday.  The other option would be to have her sign in as a visitor and have an escort.  I will let the Security Kiosk know that she will be coming that week and to issue a temp badge.
Thanks

Does that mean Rita will need to go through security every day?  My preference is to give her a temporary badge or activate her old Enron badge for the full week.

Holly, I work for Northern Natural Gas Company and in March we are going to be working on a rate refund for our customers.  Usually when we do this, we need the help of Rita Bianchi who was a Northern employee until February 1, 2002 when she became a Dynegy employee.  I was wondering if we could get Rita's badge (#40024) activated for the time that she will need to be down here to help with the rate refund which will be from March 18 thru March 24.  She will need access to the 42nd floor which is the floor that I work on plus the 40th floor which is the floor that our IT people work on.  Please let me know if we can get this to work since that would make it so much easier for her to come and go for the time that she will be down here with us.

Thanks for your help,

Raetta

Thanks for talking to Ange.  I'll give her a call tonight.

My preference is for me to take 3/17; you to take 3/24 (I'll have company); and no children's church on Easter.  Let me know what you think.

Hi Shelley:
I talked to Ange yesterday, and she and Bobbie can lead C/C this Sunday 3/10. 
 She stopped by my house today and picked up all the materials.  Sorry to not 
have told you earlier of my plans for this weekend.  It's all worked out, 
thankfully.
Let me know what you want to do the rest of the Sundays in March.  I'm 
available for any of the remaining Sundays in March, including Easter.  I 
know I owe you one, so let me know what you would like for me to do.
Thanks for a wonderful luncheon yesterday.  I think things are off to a good 
start with VBS!

Rita,

I was recently quizzing payroll on why I received two W-2s (which sum in aggregate to my 12/31/01 payroll stub) when I thought had been employed by the same co. (366) all year.  Her records indicated that you had entered a change during the year.  Could you look into why I can listed as having worked for both Enron Operations Services Co & Enron Corp. in 2001?

Second, I received an email from Mike Mcgowan just a few moments ago wherein he is proposing a response to your request.  By copy of this memo, you can anticipate that Mike will forward a response shortly.

Sorry I missed your call last night.  I had a good cry and went to bed early.  
 
As you noted in your voice message, I am planning to travel by myself on Saturday, Dec 15.  It is the only time I can get a confirmed flight (albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive).  
 
Here is the other part of my plans.  I feel fairly sure that I will return to the US immediately after my court date, unless the stay requirements are very, very short.  I can fathom the courage to travel by myself, but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself.  Also, all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me.
 
I am still planning to have Connie move forward with getting Kim a letter of invitation /VISAs -- including a Russian VISA that is good until Mid-January.  That way Kim can return for Alina after the first of the year if necessary.  Please ask Sergei to look into possible arrangements.  I would be happy to pay for Sergei and Larisa to have a holiday in Moscow if they were willing to fly with Alina there.  Perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to Almaty.  
 
I am totally terrified about traveling by myself  -- but this isn't a fear that will ease with time.  I feel like I just have to dive in or I am going to change my mind.
 
I need some reassurance on what happens at the airport.  Will the assistance service help me at customs?  Will Sergei pick me up and where will I find him?  Do I have hotel accomodations (if so preferrably at the Hyatt)?
 
Obviously I am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without Liz.  I wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why I am leaning towards leaving on Sat.

Please send to all ETS Gas Logistics


In the never ending world of changes at Enron, upper management has determined that we will not be using the PEP system for feedback this year.   I apologize that this decision was made after you put time into selecting reviewers and completing reviews.   I have not received word on whether ETS year-end feedback will occur in any alternate form.  

As a result of this development, the feedback training session for this afternoon is cancelled.

Swimming accessories
Loving Family Dollhouse Furniture & Accessories
Gift certificates

* In lieu of gifts, contributions can be made in Alina's honor to Kidsave International

Peggy,

Your email notice was timely as I was just thinking about you.  I have wanted to congratulate you on your promotion.  I am so happy for you.  I find it validating, especially at this time at Enron, to know that good things do happen to good people.

Give me a call if you can ever break free for lunch.  I would like to catch up with you on business matters, and more importantly, on international adoptions.  I know that you have already navigated these waters and I am looking forward to travel to Kazakhstan to adopt a little girl.

Best wishes to you and your family for the holidays.

Thank you for your thoughts.  I am fine.   Our pipeline companies were not included in the bankruptcy petition and we are continuing operations normally.  While these have certainly been stressful times and a sad day for the many Enron employees that lost their jobs today, we have not had any workforce reductions in our area.  It's a little lonely in the building and I have to make sure to put my lipstick on before I go down to the lobby to face all the TV cameras camped out down there!

I know that the long term solution rests with Charlie Thompson.  But, Caroline, I'm frankly shocked at GMS seeming lack of concern for the seriousness of this situation.  I have serious leadership questions about a group that could continue to receive charts in after the 5th of the month (on ALL 16 charts!) and continue to just file these reports without ever even looking at them or making corrections.  When ask why they never raised the issue or brought it to management's attention, their response is that this is the way we've done things for 20 years.  

I'd like to visit with you about the leadership and direction of the GMS group.  No problem with measurement data is ever GMS responsibility -- its always someone elses fault -- the field didn't get the info in in time, the OMV wasn't received, the system doesn't work....What is the level of service that GMS is accountable for.  Please understand that this criticism is not directed to you.  I'd just like a chance to brainstorm with you one on one about how we ever have this group enter the 21st century with the rest of us -- befort Dave Neubauer raises his frustrations to the highest levels of ETS.

Shelley, I would like to see Charlie Thompson or a representative from operations at this meeting since a major issue which will have to be addressed is the physical measurement equipment on NNG's pipe. GMS has not had much success in getting measurement equipment upgrades out of operations.  Customer issues may be the justification needed for the upgrades.  I will also plan on being there along with Gary.   cvb

	Unfortunately I will be on vacation on November 26th.  However, Gary will be attending and is well versed and postured to speak to 16 and 31 day charted PD measurement.  Gary has been working behind the scenes with your group, the field, marketing and technology to resolve the problems associated with equipment not suited for providing adequate daily information.  At the same time he has been working on gaining assistance in getting 16 day measurement data into the office on time for processing and review prior to month's end close.   Just as a side note, I understand now that Charlie Thompson of the Measurement Technology Group and Tech Ops has been given the charge to come up with a five year plan for installing automated and adequate equipment accross the board for these situations.

Ellis/Gary

I hope that you can both make it to the meeting on Monday to discuss the issue of daily NNG measurement readings.  A number of our NNG customers are protesting DDVC invoices based on our inability to provide daily measurement information.   Alliant is just the latest in the string of customers.   The NNG marketing group is very frustrated on this issue.  

We need to put all our collective talents together.  This issue needs the highest levels of attention possible form measurement.

Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.

Catherine,

Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would be emailing you.   

This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.  

We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.

We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.

Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.  

In His Name,

Shelley Corman

Kent,

I can get together on Tues.  at 1:30.

I certainly want to make this report as useful as possible.  But, in some regards I feel like I failed my group in not memorializing the notes from our Omaha meeting on the specific changes that we agreed as a group to make to the report.  I have kept Dale in a state of fiddling with this report for two months now.   For example, my notes from our meeting reflect the fact that we decided against trend information.  I am certainly willing to change that decision if you guys collectively agree.

Have you considered whether we need different types of reports rather than try to accomplish all on this page.  The purpose of the current page is for gas logistics to report on what is happening on the system (i.e. how the physical world is tracking to the paper world).   We need to run through this exercise from a gas logistics side each day even if it isn't meaningful to marketing.  I'm not adverse to the concept of studying shifts in gas flows from day-day or year-year, but perhaps this is a distinct analytical tool.

Hopefully we can work out these details on Tues & then run with it.

Shelley,

The changes are an improvement.  Both Jo and I were thinking that we were moving toward having a summary section where the system-wide balance was addressed.  This would include things such as a summary receipt/delivery balance, how gas is moving across the system at key pipeline points, how much capacity (such as at Clifton) that is used for transport vs. contract storage vs. operational storage (line pack changes).

Also, we were looking for some longer term trend information such as what were the zones in the Market Area and other key points were using last year so we can see the year-on-year trends.

We find ourselves talking about specific volumes at specific points and we feel that it would add a broader feel as to what is happening on the system if we can start with a broader look at the entire system and then move into more of a location by location/point information.  These were some of the things that we wanted to sit down and talk about to be sure that were all on the same page.  Could we plan on getting together after Lynn's brown-bag lunch presentation (about 1:30)?

Thanks,

Kent

 I'm good with getting together on Tuesday, but I would also like any major formatting feedback in advance of the meeting if possible so that we can walk away from the meeting on Tuesday with the final product.  Otherwise, I'm concerned that we'll never get out of the cycle of perpetual feedback & differences in preferences of formatting style.

Liz - Right after I had Kim run over with the revised form and put it in the overnight, Chris called me to say that the application will probably need the "sworn and subscribed" language before the notary stamp.   

Do you have a typewriter that you could type this in above the notary stamp?  Or perhaps feed it through your computer printer?  I sent three signed and notarized copies -- so you have a few extras to play with.



Here is the missing language


STATE OF TEXAS  
COUNTY OF HARRIS

Sworn and subscribed before me on this 26th day of November, 2001.



My conversation with Chris was quite different than my conversation with Ginger.  While she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like Jan 5 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares.  She also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around Dec 17 might be possible if one didn't mind being away at Christmas.

On my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in Astana.  When I called her back she said that this was a mistake -- that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in Astana on Thurs or Fri.


You can call me at home tonight if you want to talk.

Subject: RE: Restated 2002 CAPEX Plan


Don,
 
I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.
 
With respect to the specific project listed:
 
1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.
 
 
With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:
 
2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.
 
3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.  
 
 
An additional footnote should be added to the page.
 
4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.

Both Kim's parents & my mom will be at the house on Christmas eve/Christmas day -- so I think they'll eat their Christmas meal at our house.  I'm sure that Kim, Chad, Mom and Nevin would appreciate a Christmas evening dessert invite.  You can coordinate when you see them for Mexican food on Sat. night.

Have fun at the violin concert.

Hi. Just checking into see how you are doing. As you know, other than
putting up lights and wrapping gifts, I am here to assist (shopping, baking,
card playing, Lego building, dog or cat sitting, Mother entertainment). Do
you think your clan would like to come over for Christmas dinner or at least
in the evening for some dessert? ( I realize you are probably not focused on
food now, but...)
I ordered the phrase book and John, Brianna, and I will start studying.
Tonight, we are going to Miss B's Christmas violin concert!

Take care,

I am looking for a way to assist a co-worker that is under stress with a wife with health problems, a baby and two other children at home.  I am interested in getting details about how I might pre-pay for a two-week personal chef service.  

Could you give me a quote on two-week service to this family located in the Copperfield area? 
Could the gift recipient select the menu items?

For those of you who have continued to participate in your Corporate Responsibility Task Force subcommittee since the task force was folded into the Culture Committee, thanks for your continuing help.  And for those of you who have not participated lately, we are asking you to join us once more for a final meeting.  As you recall, the subcommittees are:

Asset-related Activities 
External Accountability 
Internal Communication and Accountability 
Market Opportunity 
Measurement and Benchmarking 


The subcommittee goals are attached: 

<<CRTFgoals.doc>> 
I would like to pull together everyone who has been involved over the past year in the Corporate Responsibility initiative for a final review of all subcommittee recommendations.  Subcommittee chairs will then take these recommendations to Ken Lay and the policy committee, so we want to make sure that our final product accurately reflects the input that all of you have had this year.

Please identify your preferred dates (listed below), and respond to Stacy Walker via e-mail or at 713-853-3583.  The meeting should last less than one hour.

Thanks; look forward to seeing everyone again.

I want to clarify something from our Reg Roundtable earlier today. Bearpaw is currently a "potential marketing affiliate" of NBPL, and so far has not  crossed the line to actually trigger an event that would make them a full fledged MA. We are careful not to trigger such an event. Bearpaw may be a MA of NNG due to some contract activity on NNG, but that is not a problem for NBPL. Shelly, if you see it differently, please let me know.

Due to the Bankruptcy Filing on December 2, 2001, a decision was made to discontinue the flexperq allowance.  This decision was made after the December 14 payroll run.  You will receive your allowance of $181.17 on your December 14 paycheck; however,  Payroll will reduce your 12/31 paycheck for the same amount.

Also, please note that executive physicals will no longer be offered or related expenses covered by Enron.

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

Of interest -
Gas Logistics combined 2001 payroll is $8,209,648.  The 2002 Plans were built with a 4.25% combined merit and other which equates to $348,910.  At 3.75% the combined merit and other equates to $307,862, a reduction of $41,048.  Over the next few days, I will be rebuilding the 2002 revised plan for distribution.

Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.  The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibity to the peak.  So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.  I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to refect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case

Lisa - we got the revised 2002 capital budget & I'm looking at both your spreadsheet and the budget.  A couple of questions for my clarification:
 

Could you fill in the blanks or correct:
 
        CMS/CRS   

Total Cost for NNG - $_____?____ 

Paid in 2001             $406 K 
Budgeted for 2002    $130 K     
Balance (if any) $___?___      
Remaining customization for NNG is $693K less $300K for Deal Sheet = $393K customization for CMS/CRS (correct?)

CMS/CRS   $100K for Interface to TRS/TAS - Is this considered a separate project from above and if so, is this included anywhere in 2002 Budget?

CAS     

Total Cost $154K, correct?   
Budget for 2002 $54K; is remaining $100K in 2003 or already paid for in 2002?  
What department is this budgeted in (Operations?)

R&R      2002 Plan = $548,481 (of which Deal Sheet is $300 K) 
  Is this total cost or was some paid in 2001 or projected for 2003?        

R&R 2002 Cap Budget shows $548K less $252K paid in Jan. = 296K 
Cap Budget also shows 130K for CMS 
= $426K budgeted in Gas Logistics for CMS & R&R.  
How does that link to the $463K Total Required shown on your worksheet (esp. Interface to TRS/TAS)?

Thanks! Jane

Subject:	Need Communications Coverage for LA incident

OCC has called me and I am on the call and the operations folks seem irritated with my explanation that I no longer cover communications so I have jotted down the notes on the call and would like to hand over to you as appropriate.

Summary notes from Tom Mertz
-There was an oil spill on the Block 49 platform off the coast of LA in Elod (sp?) Bay on an EOTT facility.  
- Have 2 people on blocks but they are busy with booms (so they are out of communication) and others are on the way to the site to bring up communications.
- The spill was initially reported at 10 barrels.  But later received report that slick reported as 250 ft wide x 1.2 mi long.  And it is nearing the bank/shore.
- Going to do fly over.
- Govt agencies have been called including the Coast Guard. Coast Guard will meet us at site. 
- We have deployed US environmental to do containment and cleanup
-There is concern that news will cover when slick reaches shore.

She has absolutely everything.  A gift isn't necessary.  I'm working on family pictures for her -- so a recent one of you guys would be great.  And, if you want she could use a photo album or scrapbook for her story.

Call me anytime for info.  I'll let you know the next time I'll be in DC and you are always welcome to hop on down to Houston for a weekend.  Tracey is coming next weekend.  We'll be in State College around July 4.

Keep me posted!

Boy do I have a lot to fill you in on job wise.  Here is the short version.  Yes I have a new job.  But, surprise, it's still at Enron.  I am just swamped and will not have the 2 weeks off I expected so there is definitely no weekday San Marcos trip in my future.

We have no plans for Easter -- other than the fact that Alina is scheduled to be baptized at 8:30 AM church.  The Plaza/Houston/Met clubs have an Easter brunch that looks like it could be fun.  On the other hand we could just relax pool side.  We'd love to spend the day with you and gimpy.  Just let me know your leisure preferences.

Hi. How was your weekend? I hope you had a nice visit with your guests. 

As you can imagine I spent most of the weekend caring for John. He actually
slept quite a bit on Saturday but I thought I should stick around in case he
needed something. Yesterday, he started to get a little more mobile but it
is going to be a while before he is "back on his feet." He did go to work
today and starts physical therapy today as well.

I hope to see you all sometime soon. What are your plans for Easter?

Subject: FW: Press Release -- NERC Expands Role


FYI -- NERC is expanding their role to include development of wholesale electric business practice standards, in addition to reliability standards.  It looks like they're making it clear that they don't want an EISB developing wholesale electric standards.  They plan to be the single organization for developing these standards.  They've even added balanced voting for their committees.  I don't know the details, but they're using pieces of GISB's process that they know work and that people like.

Some GISB representatives have been making it look as if everyone in the energy industry is on board with EISB.  Clearly, they're not.

I'll let you know if I hear anything else.

NERC Expands Role

At a watershed meeting today in Vancouver, BC, the North American Electric
Reliability Council's (NERC) Board of Trustees took bold steps to expand
its
role for developing standards for the wholesale electric industry in North
America.

Michehl R. Gent, NERC President and CEO, said, "On the strength of strong
recommendations from the NERC Stakeholders Committee, the Board pledged to
take all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America
to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business
practice standards and to file such standards with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) and appropriate government agencies in
Canada."

"NERC is committed," says Gent, "to establishing a fair, open, balanced,
and
inclusive process for developing all standards."  NERC's Board approved a
new process for developing standards and agreed to a new composition and
weighted sector voting model for its standing committees.

NERC has long been recognized and respected as the industry's developer of
standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected
transmission systems throughout North America.  These standards have been
the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems for over
30 years.

Richard Drouin, Chairman of NERC, stated, "The Board of Trustees recognizes
the urgent need for a single organization to develop both reliability
standards and wholesale electric business practice standards that are well
coordinated.  Such standards," Drouin added, "are vital to support the
evolution of competitive electricity markets, the formation of large
regional transmission organizations, and continued reliability and security
of interconnected transmission systems."

Today's actions are a major step toward formalizing a role that NERC has
filled for some time.  NERC spearheaded the OASIS "What" and "How" Working
Groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed
by
all transmission providers; formed a Market Interface Committee to address
the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market
practices on reliability; and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling
Collaborative, which recently filed a report with FERC on its efforts to
develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling (OASIS
Phase II).

To accomplish its reinvention, NERC will actively solicit support from
Canadian and U.S. government entities, and facilitate ? jointly with
interested trade associations; federal, state, and provincial regulators;
and other stakeholder organizations ? an open and inclusive process to
achieve consensus on the details of its new role.

In parallel actions, the Board also took steps to ensure the independence
of
actions by its 21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail
merchant functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting
structure of its standing committees.

For more information on NERC or its transformation into NAERO, visit NERC's
web site (http://www.nerc.com/). The web site also includes information on
the electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and
activities.


*********************


NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America. It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to "keep the lights on" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems. NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account for
virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada, and a
portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

Keep up the great work.  I know things have been really stressful for you lately.  It was terrific to have you to rely on when I was away (and when I'm here too!)

Shelley;
Sorry to hear of all the Enron problems topped off by your bus experience
on Friday. It was obviously a professional who preys on victims every day.
I assume you are going to Kazakhstan on Thursday, probaly arriving in
Almaty late Friday night. I hope your flight goes direct from Frankfurt or
Amsterdam direct to Almaty. It saves a little hassle if you avoid Moscow,
unless you plan to do some touring before going on to Kazakhstan.
I have been to Almaty two times. It is a beautiful city surrounded by snow
capped mountains. If you have a vivid imagination you can see China just
across the mountains.
You can contact the following folks who can help you if you get stuck. Elza
Utegenova spent a semester with us last year. She teaches at The Kazak
State Agrarian University. She speaks excellent English and is a wonderful
person. She does not have a car or telephone. She could help arrange city
travel. You should make arrangements before you depart, unless you are
taking a lap-top with you.
You could also contact Daulet Chunkunov, country director for WINROCK
INTERNATIONAL in Kazakhstan. He has been to Pennsylvania
and we have visited with him on both of our trips to Almaty. He speaks good
English, has a car, email, and telephones. His email is
dc@winrock.lorton.com. Cell phone 8 333 210 8320. Other phone 3272
63-05-56. Fax(3272)63-15-55.
I am completing this after talking with you by telephone.
Good luck and keep in touch,
Lou

I forgot to send the address list before we left for Austin.  I'll give it to you tomorrow.

Alina, Chad and I will meet you and Miss B tomorrow at 1:30 at T and C Starbucks.  Then we can go to Zainy Brainy.  How long can you guys shop?  I have some gift certificates for Ann T, Gap and Gymboree.

What is the shower at Patsy's for? When do you have to be there?

Kim has to travel to Indonesia on business Feb 8 to Feb 19.

Now that we have Alina's initial visit out of the way and she has stopped talking about the bad ("jaman") nurse that gave her the shots,  I guess it's time to plan round two.

Please let me know the appropriate timing to schedule a follow-up visit for further immunizations.

Thanks

Thanks.  I got your voice message. 

 I'm good with getting together on Tuesday, but I would also like any major formatting feedback in advance of the meeting if possible so that we can walk away from the meeting on Tuesday with the final product.  Otherwise, I'm concerned that we'll never get out of the cycle of perpetual feedback & differences in preferences of formatting style.

Just got home from work ... but that is funny, cause I'm still working -- now at home.  Guess you've probably heard about events at my company.
 
If you couldn't see the red -- the editorial notes were also in parentheticals
 
You dickens -- you were only supposed to get Chad 1 item from the list.  Then I pass it on to Tracey, Pat, Arliene etc.

Didn't see an editorial notes in red but I did really enjoy the article.  
Thanks for sending it to me. 

I'll send you this e-mail but I may talk with you tonight.  I'll try in a 
while. 

We went to Sam's Club tonight and later, we went to the Mall to look for 
"Chad stuff."  Got the Backyard Football Game...hope I got the right one.  It 
says "Back-yard Football 2002 NFL.  Win/Mac CD-ROM ...was $19.99.  Also found 
a Harry Potter item at B. Dalton bookstore.  Not sure if this is one of the 
things on the list.  I bought the Harry Potter Trading Card Game (Two-Player 
Starter Set)..it was $12.00.  The Harry Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows) 
comes out 11/16.  I'll get it when it comes out.  But, tell me if the other 
items are O.K. 

Love, 
Mom

Chris,

I was about to send off the info from the prior email when I received your latest update.  However, I'm confused by the update.  The form seems to be the same, except it is intended to be sent to the Republic of Kazakhstan in New York.  Is that really where we are sending our registration information?  What about the autobiography.  What is that, What is required?  

I understand the urgency in registering and am prepared to do what it takes to accomplish this today.  But, frankly this whole process was a surprise to me.  Does your agency have an written materials on follow-up requirements/processes in general.  I'm sort of at a loss on the whole issue of what comes next.  When to apply for SS#.  What about readoption.  Passport, Certificate of Citizenship, etc.  I was surprised when a resident alien card arrived.

I need to take care of the registration issue today, as we will be on vacation starting tomorrow for a week.

Hi,

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.  Chad had soccer practice last night & I have something I must do tonight.  I'm taking the day off tomorrow.  Would there be a good time to visit tomorrow?  When is Tom home from school - so he and Chad could play.  Or, if you'd rather, I'd be happy to sit with Kathleen or the kids anytime this weekend.

Two other items when you get a chance:
-Are you still selling Nutcraker tickets?  I can't recall the date.
-Are you still interested in me selling Shopping Cards at Enron.  I need to reserve dates/table space in lobby.

Hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

Shelley

Here's my first stab


Key Findings
1. With only one significant exception, the groups acknowledge their tasks/responsibilities in the measurement process.  The only area that appears to be lacking defined roles/responsibility is follow-through on open issues/corrections that are not made prior to close
2.  The main issues with late data for billing relate to execution and lack of communication follow-through
3.  There needs to be an added focus in the field about how their tasks relate to the NNG billing process.  Current procedures are written solely in the context of calculating UAF.
4.  The customers chart changing arrangements raise audit concerns and concerns about our ability to gather timely data for billing.


Recommendations

1. Educate field and GMS staff on use of measurement data in billing -- combination of written materials and presentations  (Gas Logistics).
2. Renegotiate chart changing agreements/gain understanding of timing parameters.
3. Assign responsibility for past month issues past measurement close.
4. Develop single point of organizational accountability for quality/timeliness of data fed into PGAS, including Field Teams with respect to their measurement duties; measurement technology, GMS and UAF specialist.

After that, do you think that you and I should walk through the whole plan with the key people in your group (and maybe Steve's)?  Give me a call if you haven't received the Plan handouts by tomorrow.  Thanks.

Donna,
In a Dynegy meeting this afternoon, we were instructed to change the Gas Logistics Dynegy Plan -- which we had submitted at $6.363M --
back to the Original Plan of $6.864M.  They viewed the reduction as more of a Current Estimate, so from this point, we will use the $6.864M as the official plan number for future comparisons.  (At least for Dynegy purposes.)
I will resubmit the plan to Steve Kleb this afternoon.   Please inform Shelley about this latest development.
Thanks,

Nancy

Jo, Kent & Dave,
 
Per our joint meeting in Omaha several weeks ago and subsequent conversations with Jo and others, the morning meeting report has been revised to:
 
- Remove unnecessary line pack and yesterday's plan info.
- Add additional interconnect points
- Add fuel and a system balance computation for the Market, Midcontinent and Permian area
- Improve formatting and readability.
 
Dale will shortly forward a draft of the new report.  Please confirm that it meets with your expectations. We would plan to put this new format in place mid-week next week.

Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.

Jan if you are here today can I get you to help me out with some info.	The most important thing I need is actual volumetric data going back and projected as far out as you have it.    You can see the splits between the gallup volumes, red rock and the pre existing deals.   I also need to verify the capacity added from the expansions.   Also need to begin to detail the volumes from Long term firm contract versus short term deals including IT etc.

Subject:	Additional TW information request

Rod,

Following our conversations today it appears necessary to include more granular information in the transwestern model.  We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers. 

This information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for "reverse synergies."  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.

I don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.  

Please let me know if you feel the template does not capture the relevant information.  I will be in at 7am tomorrow if you would like to discuss this information.  

Jayshree and I also have additional information requests from our conversations of the last two days, but I will send that information in an e-mail tomorrow.	

Thank you,
Sarah

Jackie,

Here is the Children's Church newsletter article:

Children's Church Update

A children's worship service is held each Sunday (except for Communion Sundays) during the 11:00 worship service.   Children attend the first part of the regular worship service in the Sanctuary and then proceed to children's church after the children's sermon.  Please tend to your child's personal needs before worship, so our children's church leaders can focus on teaching.

The mission of children's church is to help prepare children (ages 3 years through 3rd grade) to participate in worship.  This Fall the children are learning that our "church backpack" is filled with things that help us worship -- our bibles, hymns, offering, and prayer.  Ask your child about how to make a prayer sandwich!


Thanks
Shelley
713-853-7083

P.S.  Please send me your daughter's email when you have a chance.

Liz - I noticed that Luftansa has flights back on Dec 27 from Moscow.


Using the same itinerary that we discussed before -- but for Dec 11 returning Dec 27 listed fare is $2830.40.

Dot - 

I think Frazier did understand and was representing my view.  I'd rather that there were no tolerances in the OBA -- only the concept of reasonable balances.   With this point located in the makret area, it is quite possible that we'll be the ones with the swing (especially since we'll have flow control).  

If you prefer a tolerance in  both the termination and tolerance paragraphs I guess that's fine -- since the only remedy in either case is termination of the OBA.  The existing balance (even if over 100,000 cum) will be settled up under the OBA.

	Shelley -- 
	
	Frazier did not seem to understand my changes in the tolerance sections (4c and 4d).  
	So, to clarify:

	On the tolerances, my concern was twofold -- that we only have the 100,000 dth limit in 
	the "termination" paragraph (and not in the tolerance paragraph), and that it was not clear 
	that, even if the cumulative daily imbalances totaled only 5% of the scheduled volumes for 
	the month, the parties would work to keep it below an actual volume of 100,000 dth (or have 
	a right to terminate the agreement if it were over that amount).

In appreciation of all your efforts for WalkAmerica and the March of Dimes, you and a guest are invited to the 2001 March of Dimes' WineFest on Thursday, October 4 from 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. at the Crystal Ballroom of the Rice Hotel. It will be a great evening of food, wine, friends, and a silent auction.

Please let me know by Friday, September 28, if you will be able to attend WineFest 2001.

Thank you, again, and hope to see you there.

When I called Ginger's house today to see if she received my INS approval, one of her children answered and said that she is at Chris' house -- so I guess that means Chris has returned.  If your process estimates are in line, our documents would have to be translated by next week to hit a travel at the end of November date.  I am very concerned that we will slip to Christmas time travel.

While I'm not trying to have you do my dirty work, I feel like you have a little better standing to fuss at Ginger or Chris this week about some commitments of when paperwork will be turned in.  After all, your paperwork has been turned in for some time & you have specific health concerns for Oksana.  Since I just turned in my INS approval (even though the rest of my dossier has been in for several weeks), I feel like I don't have much standing to complain about timing.

Shelley,
I'm sure she already thinks I'm difficult. I'm pretty sure the Kaz government 
sets the court date after your dossier is registered  there. So, if our 
paperwork is not there yet, then how can she know that our court date will be 
in the time frame she thinks it is?
The more I try to understand everything she had told me the more confused I 
get sometimes. It's really hard not understanding and being in on everything 
involved in the process.
I don't know if she even knows how long the paper work will take. Chris told 
me, when I sent mine in 5 weeks ago, that the estimate was 2 weeks for 
translation, 2 weeks for the Kaz embassy, 2 weeks to be sent to Kaz and 
registered. As of Monday mine is still in translation.
I really don't know what to do right now. Should we just wait until the first 
of next week and call again and find out the status of everything?

Subject: Trustee stuff


Hi Shelley:

How are things going at home?  I hope ya'll are settling in a bit and things
are going smoother.

We had our trustee meeting last night and the subject of inventory came up.
I remember two or three years ago, we took an extensive inventory and that
each head of each group at the church inventoried their items.  I remember
doing the sanctuary and Steve doing the music inventory.  Do you know where
all the paperwork is?  Do you have it on your computer or does Lisa or
someone else?  If so, could you email it to me?  or give me the originals?
Jim said he didn't see it in the stuff you gave him.  He also can't find the
Trustee Master Binder; do you know where it is?

Thanks.

Syd  see you Saturday depending on how my gum surgery goes on Thursday.

Welcome back! I was wondering if you had 30 minutes today to discuss NNG's major customers from a strategic perspective.  Stan has asked me (on a very confidential basis) to explore various "buy back" options for NNG, including raising a lot of money!  I wanted to get your thoughts on certain customers' willingness to participate in an ownership interest in NNG.  I did not want to meet with Dave and his team given the Dynegy transition. I am free all morning except at 9 and this afternoon except from 2 to 4.

Kim,

My nonstop direct from Houston cleared for tomorrow (4:40 PM).  The only catch is that I have to go to the airport this afternoon to change my tickets.  My return back from Moscow on the 30th also cleared.   I am still waitlisted for a return flight from Almaty on the 23rd.

Fran,

I need to straighten out a few personal payroll matters before I leave town on Thursday.  I was able to revise my bank deposit instructions on ERonline (my wallet was stolen over the weekend and I had to change bank accounts).  I was also able to adjust my EFCU deductions.

I am unable to complete the following changes online and I'm hoping that you can help me work these issues:
- Stop PAC contributions
- Stop Savings Bond automatic purchases
- Stop 2002 United Way deduct.  I had selected to make one time contribution in Feb (around bonus time).  My plans are to stop the automatic deduct and have the United Way bill me directly instead.

Thanks in advance for your help.

	Shelley, we have been working with a number of Business and IT managers with the termination of IT Consultants.  In some cases, major IT projects have been cancelled and consultants have been eliminated.  There is one project at ETS, the rewrite of the contracts system, that was being staffed by some outside IT consultants ( Valtech).  Has that project been put on hold or discontinued?  If it has and the consultants are no longer here, GSS needs to be in the loop to send termination letters to the supplier.  There is specific termination language in the Master Services Agreements that we manage.  

	Please let me know the status to the project or direct me to the person who can help me.

OCC has called me and I am on the call and the operations folks seem irritated with my explanation that I no longer cover communications so I have jotted down the notes on the call and would like to hand over to you as appropriate.

Summary notes from Tom Mertz
-There was an oil spill on the Block 49 platform off the coast of LA in Elod (sp?) Bay on an EOTT facility.  
- Have 2 people on blocks but they are busy with booms (so they are out of communication) and others are on the way to the site to bring up communications.
- The spill was initially reported at 10 barrels.  But later received report that slick reported as 250 ft wide x 1.2 mi long.  And it is nearing the bank/shore.
- Going to do fly over.
- Govt agencies have been called including the Coast Guard. Coast Guard will meet us at site. 
- We have deployed US environmental to do containment and cleanup
-There is concern that news will cover when slick reaches shore.

Pre April 1997 was specifically not covered by the 6 month rule. -- but 8 don't think that means that we are automatically required to process all old ppas.  I think we should plan to manually handle any pre 1997 ppas that we feel bound to accept.

FYI I saw Ken Caminiti at Animal Kingdom yesterday!

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

Stan/Rod,

I previously mentioned to you that I have assigned John Buchanan as Mgr, TW scheduling to ensure that we have a consistent focus on TW scheduling matters and presence at the 8 AM TW morning meeting (Lynn Blair, Steve January and Terry Kowalke are in the NNG morning meeting each day at the same time).

Previously Terry Kowalke and John Buchanan split time advising the TW and NNG team on day to day scheduling matters.  Terry was sitting on 39 and John on 42.  In light of the immediate change in their assignments, I asked John and Terry to switch desks.  I need your authorization to move their telephones.

This change is important to demonstrate to the commercial groups of both NNG and TW that we will not miss a step in tending to daily business even during the transition.  

Thank you for the support.

Shelley,

FYI

A GISB ratification ballot has been distributed.  One item is the 'Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas'.  We did not participate in this effort because it doesn't affect us.

I voted in favor of it at the last EC meeting and plan to support it on the ratification ballot.  Richard Smith of ExxonMobil wants this item to be approved.  He's been very instrumental in getting our Order 637 transactional reporting issues pushed through GISB.  The transactional reporting data sets (EBB usage only) will be voted at the next EC meeting in April.  We may need his support.  Therefore, I'm supporting him on the base contract.

Ratification is due April 19.  I'll route and submit ballot as usual

Thanks,
Theresa

Shelley I just wanted to thank you for giving us the chance to win a ticket to the Astros playoff game the other day.  I know my name was not drawn, but I still had the opportunity to attend because Christine McEvoy called in sick.  It was my first time at Enron Field and I loved it. 
Thanks again,
Chris Miller

Godspeed to you and your family as you make this trip.  My younger child is adopted and it has been a wonderful blessing and experience -- he is about to celebrate his 27th birthday!  

These are difficult days -- all of us may not understand everything that is taking place but we remain committed to diligently performing our jobs.  Have a safe trip!

Sorry we were unable to have a staff meeting this morning.  I would like to have a brief (1 hr) staff meeting tomorrow or Friday instead.  Please let Ricki know about your availability.

I will be out of the office next Tuesday morning.  In my absence I have asked Mike Bryant to sit in on Stan's staff meeting and Steve January to sit in on Dan Dienstbier's meeting (both moved to Tues. due to President's Day holiday).   Please see that the normal Monday morning updates are set to these folks.  

Lynn will compile the NNG Gas Logistics bullets and send to Drew/Emily Sellers.  Donna Scott will compile similar style weekly bullets for FGT/TW/ETS.  Donna check with Toby regarding the proper posting of these bullets.

Thanks

Hi Cindy,

I know this is a trivial question in the greater magnitude of things....so just drop me an email when you get a chance.

For my 2002 UW contribution, I asked to have a lumpsum payroll deduction in Feb.  (unsual bonus time).  Now, I want to have UW just bill me instead.  I can't seem to get back into the system to change this.   ????

I have another meeting at 3.  I'll join you late if I can.  I'm just finishing up my comments on the NNG business plan and will forward shortly.

This morning I discovered and forwarded to Teb/Rob the cases of several major pipelines (Trunkline & Texas Eastern) that converted to LLC status with no protests or conditions.  These were unpublished letter orders so they don't turn up on a Westlaw search.  Teb agrees that these provide a very straight forward road map for us.

Hi Shel,

Did you say that "Flat Stanley" will arrive in a white envelope?  I received 
a yellow envelope in the mail today with no return address, my name & address 
were typed and it had a "non-profit" stamp on it.  I did not open it.  It's 
in the trash can but the garbage man doesn't go 'til Thursday... I can 
retrieve it if you think it might be the envelope from Chad.

Love,
Mom

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
	FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

Texas Gas Transmission Corporation   				Docket No.
RP01-278-002
                                                      
	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                Primary
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                                
                                Alternate
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
"RIMS" link, select "Docket#" and follow the instructions  (call
202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be
filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR
385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under
the "e-Filing" link.

Gary,

Except for this week, it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 42C1 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control.

Rod,
 
I received Don's memo before I sent out the memo that we had talked about -- so I turned the thoughts into reply comments.

Don,
 
I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.
 
With respect to the specific project listed:
 
1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.
 
 
With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:
 
2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.
 
3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.  
 
 
An additional footnote should be added to the page.
 
4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.

Bob,

FYI.  The statements about Transco not honoring EOL contracts doesn't make sense to me.  I don't understand if they are saying that they are cutting supply or not honoring transportation nominations.

I had a call from Shawn Amaya from Duke Energy who relayed information that Transco was not honoring any EOL contracts to flow.  He asked if we would post a notice if NNG was not going to flow EOL/ENA gas.  I indicated that we are presently doing business as usual with all our customers.

It's been a few days now since ENA dropped their gas supply from ENA from 250M down to approx 75-85M and FPL has settled into a pattern of how it is replacing the ENA gas and still keeping its nominations at 800M.

Here is a quick snapshot of where FPL is sourcing there gas from:

ENA					85

Florida is great.  We have been on the go all day and its been after business hours when I've gotten back to the house so I didn't get to talk to you.  But I have been reading my emails along the way and know about all the meetings next week.  And we can send out an email on our staff meeting on Monday.

Unfortunately I didn't write down the name of the person in payroll that returned my call to the main payroll number.   Whoever it was logged into their system and said that the record showed you making the co. change.  Could you give payroll a call?

Shelley,

I have checked the system and find that the only changes made to your record during 2001 are as follows:

1/1/2001 - 4/15/2001 - VP Reg & Gov. Affairs - Co. 0366
4/15/2001 - 12/16/2001 - Title change to VP Gas Logistics - no company change
12/17/2001 - 12/31/2001 - FMLA Leave - no company change

1/1/2002 - to present company change to 179E.

I have nothing indicating a company change for 2001.  

Let me know who in payroll you spoke with and maybe I can work with them to determine their conclusion.

Rita

Shelly,

As soon as SAP is back up, I will look to see what the changes made to your record were.   I'm thinking your Tax company is Corp and that perhaps you are listed as deferred comp.  That's just off the top of my head.  Again, once the system is operating again, I will check into this.

Rita,

I was recently quizzing payroll on why I received two W-2s (which sum in aggregate to my 12/31/01 payroll stub) when I thought had been employed by the same co. (366) all year.  Her records indicated that you had entered a change during the year.  Could you look into why I can listed as having worked for both Enron Operations Services Co & Enron Corp. in 2001?

Enbridge to Acquire Williams' South Texas Natural Gas Gathering, Treating a=
nd Transmission Assets
CALGARY, Alberta--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 11, 2001--Enbridge Inc. (NASDAQ:ENB=
R <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=3Denbr&d=3Dt> - news </n/e/enbr.html>; TSE:=
ENB. <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=3Denb.to&d=3Dt> - news </n/ca/e/enb.html=
>) today announced that it is purchasing natural gas gathering, treating an=
d transmission assets in south Texas from a unit of Williams (NYSE:WMB <htt=
p://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=3Dwmb&d=3Dt> - news </n/w/wmb.html>).=20
Enbridge will acquire 792 kilometres (492 miles) of gas mainlines regulated=
 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and 480 kilometres (298 miles)=
 of non-FERC regulated assets including gathering systems and pipeline late=
rals. Closing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals includi=
ng approval by FERC to remove the mainlines from jurisdiction under the Nat=
ural Gas Act.=20
The acquisition, for US$50 million, is the first to be completed by Enbridg=
e's recently created Transportation Group South, which is based in Houston =
and has overall responsibility for Enbridge's U.S. business activities. The=
 assets will be owned and operated by Enbridge's wholly owned subsidiary, E=
nbridge Midcoast Energy Inc.=20
``Acquisition of these assets enables Enbridge to further expand its geogra=
phic footprint and scale of operations,'' said Dan C. Tutcher, Enbridge Gro=
up Vice President, Transportation Group South. ``It levers off the expertis=
e that Enbridge Midcoast Energy has developed in gas gathering, processing =
and transportation, and enhances our position in the active Gulf Coast regi=
on. In addition to its strategic value, we expect the acquisition to be imm=
ediately accretive to Enbridge earnings, and to have potential for future e=
xpansion.''=20
The mainline assets include two pipelines that run from close to the Texas-=
Mexico border near Laredo and McAllen to Transco Station 30 where they conn=
ect with the Williams Transco mainline, which has connections at the Katy h=
ub and continues on to the U.S. Southeast and Northeast.=20
The non-FERC regulated assets include a 210-kilometre (130-mile) gathering =
system with a 90 million cubic feet per day capacity sour gas treatment pla=
nt and 78 ton per day sulphur recovery facilitity; 210 kilometres (130 mile=
s) of other gathering laterals; a currently inactive processing plant in Be=
e County with capacity of 60 million cubic feet per day; and a 61-kilometre=
 (38-mile) lateral connecting the two FERC-regulated mainlines.=20
Enbridge Inc. is a leader in energy transportation, distribution and servic=
es in North America and internationally. As a transporter of energy, Enbrid=
ge operates, in Canada and the U.S., the world's longest crude oil and liqu=
ids pipeline system. The Company also is involved in international energy p=
rojects, and has a growing involvement in natural gas transmission and mids=
tream businesses. As a distributor of energy, Enbridge owns and operates Ca=
nada's largest natural gas distribution company, which provides gas and ret=

nd services to a growing number of Canadian and U.S. markets. Enbridge empl=
oys approximately 6,000 people, primarily in Canada, the U.S. and South Ame=
rica. Enbridge common shares trade on The Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada =
under the symbol ``ENB'' and on the NASDAQ National Market in the U.S. unde=

Gas Logistics combined 2001 payroll is $8,209,648.  The 2002 Plans were built with a 4.25% combined merit and other which equates to $348,910.  At 3.75% the combined merit and other equates to $307,862, a reduction of $41,048.  Over the next few days, I will be rebuilding the 2002 revised plan for distribution.

Hi Everyone:
It has been a crazy first week back after the holidays, and I failed to get a 
meeting notice sent out.  Nonetheless, we will have our last meeting of the 
2001 Children's Ministry Team on Monday, January 14, at 7:30 in the 
Fellowship Hall.  This will be an informal hour-long meeting at which we will 
celebrate and review the past year as well as share dreams for the future.  
We also will have something good to eat, i.e. a low-fat (maybe) dessert!  I 
hope everyone will be able to make it.  
Happy New Year!
Barbara Thompson

P.S.  Please reply to let me know you received this message, and I would

First worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01. Total transport revenue is $180.6 million.  Other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates.  This information has been furnished to Kevin Howard.  The only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials.  I spoke with Tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for TW for this period of $200 M.  The difference is primarily fuel sales (which are not currently included in my numbers).

Galen's heart catheterization yesterday showed two major blockages, one 99% and the other 75%.  The doctors at St. Lukes installed two stints in the artery to repair these blockages.  Galen said his chest is pain free and the tightness is gone.  His incision on his thigh is very sore and he has not yet been allowed to get out of bed to walk.  I spoke to him this morning and he sounded fairly upbeat and said he should be out of the hospital later on today.  He was concerned about whether he would be able to come in to work on Saturday to process reservation billing.   I assured him that Sheila and I had it covered and he did not need to worry about it.

Subject:	Data for Comments and for Economist's Report


In order to give some concrete statistics for our argument that midstream and  production affiliates are important links in the infrastructure with affiliated  pipelines (and, of course, that applying the NOPR to pipeline affiliates would  be a disaster), please provide data to answer the following three questions. Our  customer operations guys tell me this is a pretty straigtforward exercise.O bviously, given the 13 days until comments are due, time is of the essence. So  please respond by COB Tuesday, if possible.
1. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from an affiliated interstate pipeline? For all these interconnects, how much  gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
2. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from affiliated gatherers, processors, or intrastate pipelines? For all these  interconnects, how much gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
3. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that deliver gas  into affiliated intrastate pipelines? For all these interconnects, how much gas  flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
Additionally, Michael Doane, the economist INGAA has retained, would like to  have the following information for his report. It can be anecdotal, but having  something concrete to point at is critical. He needs all the examples we can  provide of existing infrastructure (gathering-to-pipeline,  processing-to-pipeline, production-to-affiliated gathering and pipeline) that  would not have gone forward if pipelines were not allowed to coordinate with  their midstream and production affiliates. If at all possible, state the natural  gas deliverability that's there today, which would not have been there. under  the proposed rule.
As you'd suspect, this also has to be done as quickly as possible. Get the  information to me, and I'll forward it to Michael.
Thanks for your help.

Subject:=09Summary of Commission Meeting



The Commission meeting yesterday, chaired by Pat Wood, consisted of discuss=
ions on FERC's:

Administrative Issues
?=09Strategic and 2002 Business Plan
Priorities for the strategic plan for 2001 through 2005 were outlined yeste=
rday and include a) promoting secure, high-quality environmentally responsi=
ble energy infrastructure with consistent policies; b) encouraging competit=
ive markets in lieu of traditional regulation; c) protection of markets/cus=
tomers through fair market oversight; and d) efficiently running FERC. In r=
eaching these goals, FERC intends several initiatives such as removing impe=
diments to market investment, encouraging use of new technology; continuing=
 to advance competitive markets; addressing landowner, safety and environme=
ntal concerns and striving for clarity not only in specific areas such as c=
ost recovery but also in communications to stakeholders. Shortly, Staff wil=
l be recommending a twelve-month plan as part of the overall strategic plan=
.
?=09Infrastructure Adequacy
There will be a series of open commission meetings held throughout the U.S.=
 beginning in November in the West; in December or early spring a meeting w=
ill be held in the northeast and later in 2002 for the Midwest and south. T=
he intent is to reach out to the states for greater cohesion.
?=09California Infrastructure Update
Staff concluded that the California natural gas market for take-away capaci=
ty was insufficient to accept delivery of all interstate capacity. The Cali=
fornia Energy Commission released a report on September 24 that agrees that=
 more expansion in California is needed.=20

Constraint Study
FERC will complete a constraint study with associated costs that should be =
completed by November 7, 2001. Staff cited constraints in central New York =
state and California. Massey asked if the study was to provide solutions or=
 recommendations. It is a study to identify the constrained areas and the r=
esulting costs to consumers.

RTO
FERC is imposing additional "incentives" to encourage the formation or join=
ing in RTOs. The Midwest, Northeast and Southeast RTOs will be considered a=
t a FERC meeting in October. There will be a series of meetings in "RTO wee=
k" to focus on congestion management, cost recovery, marketing monitoring, =
transmission planning, reliability standards and transmission rights. A NOP=
R is expected to be issued on market design and structure.

Marketing Affiliate NOPR, RM01-10
The Notice of Propose Rulemaking would apply one set of rules across both n=
atural gas pipelines and electric utilities. Under the proposal, transmissi=
on providers must operate independently and treat all customers on a nondis=
criminatory basis.  The rules would be codified in a new section of the reg=
ulations and would broaden the definition of affiliate to include all "ener=
gy affiliates."  The only exception noted in the discussion was the exclusi=
on of Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) from the definition of ene=
rgy affiliates.   =20

The Commission was presented two options to address the applicability of th=
e rule to public utilities' native load merchant functions.     =20

Option A:  Status Quo - the rule would not apply to the bundled retail merc=
hant function.
Option B:  The rule applies to the bundled retail merchant function and wou=
ld prohibit merchant employees from having access to the control room of th=
e utility.=20

After extensive discussion, the NOPR was approved 4-0 with additional langu=
age added on behalf of Commissioner Breathitt to state that Option B may no=
t be included in the final rule and encourage comments by affected parties =
and the States.

Massey questioned whether the NOPR is primarily focusing on broadening the =
definition of "energy" affiliate and whether there are any energy-type affi=
liates that would be exempt. Staff responded that the emphasis is on broade=
ning the definition to include all "energy affiliates" and no energy-type m=
arketing affiliates would be exempt, except RTO's.

The proposed rule extents the current prohibition against disclosing certai=
n information to all "energy affiliates".  The rules do not directly govern=
 energy affiliates, but they govern the disclosure of information and the s=
eparation of transmission employees, officers and directors from other busi=
nesses.=20

Under the proposal, waivers may be requested, if operationally required or =
under emergency protocols particularly for small systems.

Gas Pipeline Operational Flow
FERC has tabled this item for the next public meeting on October 11.=20

When it comes to commitments involving website postings, scheduling or balancing, could I please ask that my group be copied on settlements and proposals.  It is not my intent to meddle in your good efforts -- just to make sure that I understand what is involved in complying.

In the case of the Transwestern setttlement offer -- my only comment/concern is that I would hope we could coordinate our posting formats with the GISB rules -- otherwise we will have conflicting requirements & have the expense of having different posting formats for our different pipes. 
"Transwestern will work in good faith to simplify the exising posting formats on its electronic bulletin board,
consistent with the GISB formats for informational postings. " 

Is there an SLA settlement/proposal that I can get a copy of?

My thought is that the Enron contract is probably going away anyhow so that it makes sense to set this up for Jan 1.  I think the charges should be recorded to the balancing tools account.

Please let me know if you want me to go ahead and sign up for this package. I'll have to let Platts know the user's name and billing information etc...

Rick - Stan has announced that there is a hiring freeze in effect.  We will not be permitted to fill this position without making a special appeal to Stan.  Couple this with the fact that I need to present to Danny/Stan a proposal on how we can trim our 2002 O&M and I'm not inclined to make such a pick.   Lets talk about how we can redeploy our current resources to cover....I especially want to talk about how we pick use the accounting coordinators in an expanded role.

Unlike the situation with Michelle Cormier, in which my group absorbed the work associated with her vacancy, I will seek to obtain approval to replace Pat's position.

It hasn't been announced yet, but to keep you informed, I have been promoted to Director effective 02/01. I received the official word this morning. Apparently a memo will go out shortly with several promotions listed. There aren't any planned organizational changes, just a title change.

Thank you for all of your support. I've always enjoyed working in and around Gas Control and hope to continue to do so in the future.

HI Shelley,

Attached is a draft of the Northern IM.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could read it and provide any and all editorial comments.  I was hoping that you could provide the answers to the questions which Kevin forwarded to you earlier but I also would love someone to take a look at the overall IM and tell me if it is accurate, structured well, and "salesy."  Kevin said that you were one of the best people to do so given your knowledge of the pipeline.  

Thank you so much for all of your help.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me anytime today or this weekend.

Are you at all worried that this starts the move to zone rates in the market area?  Do we care?  Are we worried about having competitive Zone E/F rates?

If all of marketing is in agreement and we can demonstrate the elements sufficently to include in the filing.  How will this work in the field area??  Doesn't this conceptually give everyone the same priority or we narrowing it down to within the MID?  MK

Subject: Re: Draft Order No. 637 Filing



In our meetings today on Order No. 637, we failed to discuss the topic of alternate point priorities "within-the-path". Marketing indicated in a meeting yesterday that they would like a change to alternate rights in the Market Area.  That change would provide that use of an alternate point within the operational zone where the shipper's primary rights are located would have priority over alternate rights in an operational zone where the shipper doesn't have primary.  This means we would have another level of alternate to be added to the tariff.  For example, if Minnegasco made an alternate nomination in Zone D at E.Dubuque, they would have a lower alternate right than Wisconsin Gas at E.Dubuque.
 
Please provide any comments you have on this issue along with your other comments requested to be provided to Maria by COB on Monday.  
 
p.s. I recognize this would fall into the category of "needing system changes so it may take awhile".

Subject:	ENA January Imbalance Cashout

	To further respond to questions about the ENA imbalance as we reported in the accounts meeting on Thursday, the Receipt Point imbalance of 9,896 was the result of measurement PPA's for Nov. 01,  Oct. 01, and Aug. 01 at Matagorda 665 and Northwest Frisco on ENA's pooling agreement k5166. 
           The No Notice imbalance of 1,616 that was recorded as ENA's imbalance should have been on Pratt and Whitney's own DPOA contract, but was not because the old system and the new system needed to be synchronized.  Most of this imbalance was traded with FGU (they forgot about the 40 mmbtus of fuel) leaving only a small amount on ENA.  This situation has now been repaired so it will not be a problem prospectively.  Starting February,  the Pratt and Whitney point in on FGU's DPOA.

II.
MOTION TO INTERVENE
The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines.
2.      Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  In some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases Enron is a part owner.  These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines.
The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party.  Thus, the Enron Interstate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest.
III.
COMMENTS
            The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein.
            Like INGAA, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition.  First, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.  Second, the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates.   
            Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights.  
            For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment, the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition.

From:            Pipeline Segment
 
Re:            Business Practices Subcommittee Priority Action Items 1 and 2 and R00026 
 
 
At the scheduled December 14, 2000 GISB Executive Committee meeting, the agenda includes a discussion and vote on Recommendations and Proposed Standards.  This agenda item contains certain BPS proposals related to implementation of Order No. 637 requirements and related standards such as R00026.   Among the proposals are new or revised standards for capacity releases and recalls which include support for intraday capacity releases and would remove current GISB restrictions against partial-day recalls. 
 
Our fundamental concern with the proposed standards is that they do not fully address the far-reaching impact of flowing day recalls.  There are significant operational concerns with these standards.  We are concerned about whether the operational provisions are in place to ensure that the recalled party does not continue to flow, particularly during critical periods.  We are concerned about whether current GISB communication time frames are adequate for handling the ripple effect of flowing day recalls across the grid.   The proposed standards address only one narrow operational concern - whether gas has been scheduled on the particular contract to be recalled.  This does not begin to address the operational challenges of the recall or the potential impact to other transactions across the grid.  
 
Given these operational concerns, we do not understand the rush to adopt flowing day recall standards.  While we understand that this work is in response to R00026, we do not believe that flowing day recalls are necessary to fulfill the scheduling equality requirements of Order No. 637.   Order No. 637 requires that replacement shippers have the same nomination opportunities as shippers acquiring original capacity.  There are no existing pipeline contracting or scheduling functions that are the equivalent of the recall of capacity by a releasing shipper. Very few pipelines have received authorization to sell hourly services and most pipeline tariffs prescribe a uniform hourly flow rate throughout the day.   Further, most pipelines have not yet received approval to implement balancing provisions to address daily price fluctuations or intraday variability. 
 
In the spirit of compromise, we have worked on and concurred with revised standards that permit intraday releases.  However, under these revised standards, all capacity release options continue to be available only on Business Days to insure that the proper contractual relationships and notice provisions are supported.  Nonetheless, throughout the negotiations on this compromise approach, the pipelines have made it clear we cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards.  
 
Aside from our opposition to the flowing day recall standards, the pipelines have agreed to other recall standards that are more liberal than are supported by the existing standards.  In this area, we have agreed to support a revised standard which will permit capacity to be recalled for transactions in the Evening Nomination Cycle.  This allows a releasing shipper to recall capacity until the afternoon of the day prior to gas flow.  While this timeline supports a shorter notice for recalls, it still preserves the application of the full-day contract entitlement and gas flow rights for both the releasing and the replacement shippers.  Flowing day recalls, though, are a separate issue.  Flowing day recalls could significantly increase the incidence of scheduling problems, overruns, imbalances and increased occurrences of Operational Flow Orders.  Because of the potentially disruptive nature of flowing day recalls, pipelines cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards. 
 
Any move from daily increments of service to partial-day increments of service must be undertaken in the context of all services offered on each pipeline system, including firm services, interruptible services, and balancing and operational provisions. Because these developments involve changes to tariffs and customers service offerings, this is not an area that is currently ripe for GISB development.
 
The attached Pipeline Segment position paper incorporates the concepts identified above into the BPS recommendation and is offered as an alternative to the BPS recommendation.

Shelley,  here is a copy of the UAF sub-committee findings and recommendations.   This is the committee I was on for a year.    I really believe this is a good document with a lot of valuable data but it is very large.   MIPS was the GMS system when this was written so many of the reports were MIPs generated.     They are working on reports for PGAS using "Business Objects" and Jodie and I will be receiving some one on one training tomorrow afternoon.

Hey guys,

	I sent an amendment to Dan McCarty, for signoff by the NNG President. last week (before the memo) and was told that Danny would no longer be signing agreements for NNG; Danny instructed me to send the agreements to Dan Dienstbier.  Well, Dan Dienstbier just told me he can't sign them either.  Who is the interim NNG President/General Manager?  Any suggestions?

Don,
 
I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.
 
With respect to the specific project listed:
 
1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.
 
 
With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:
 
2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.
 
3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.  
 
 
An additional footnote should be added to the page.
 
4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.

Patty, Stephanie & Barbara,

I have samples of Group's VBS curriculum and Children's Church curriculum and would like to get together and see what you think.

Group's VBS this year is called Bug Safari (think "Bug's Life").  The bible lessons are about David and play on theme of little in size, big in spirit.  The video (that can be used during refreshment time & is the basis of our Friday evening program) features Chatter the Chipmunk -- so we could reuse the adorable costume Ann Turney made.  I would like to select the curriculum with you guys before we have our volunteer luncheon (which I would like to do in late Feb or early March).   I would also like to agree on the date in mid-late July for VBS.  I think I currently have 2 weeks penciled on the church calendar.

I also have ordered samples of Group's Children's Church curriculum.  I have been struggling lately with inspiration for new lessons and some pre-prepared lessons might help us draw in additional volunteers.  Most of our volunteers are enthusiastic about helping -- but not preparing -- a children's church worship.  

Evening meetings are difficult for me right now -- as there is much to do in the evenings and little time.  I would love to meet sometime this weekend if you are available.  (Kim will be out of the country the first few weekends in Feb.) or I can meet on Fri. Feb 1 or Fri. Feb 8  - if either of those days suit.

Let me point out, this is NOT sucking up.  

However, congratulations on your new endeavor.

I know it's too early to consider, but in the future, if you decide there is a position available in your new group, please consider me.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not unhappy where I am, just seeking opportunities to expand.

I bring 28 years experience in a variety of areas both in TW and NNG including Contracts, Scheduling, and Gas Control.

Again congratulations and good luck.

I think we expected it.  The ALJ said he need more time for his decision.  On a positive note, it gives the parties more time to discuss settlement

Subject:	NGI's Article on the Decision Delay

Initial ALJ Decision in Transwestern Case Delayed 
FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. has extended by two weeks the deadline for an initial decision in the case in which Transwestern Pipeline is alleged to have arranged more lucrative negotiated-rate deals last winter prior to posting available firm transportation capacity to its web site -- a move that extracted higher rates and limited the capacity availability for recourse-rate shippers for service to California. 
Due to "scheduling conflicts," Wagner pushed back the deadline for president ALJ Jacob Leventhal to issue a decision to Oct. 30 from Oct. 15. 
FERC ordered the hearing in late July to determine whether Transwestern exercised market power in arranging negotiated-rate contracts for capacity that led to some shippers being charged up to $27/MMBtu in February, which the Commission estimated was "70 times the recourse rate."

Can you please advise what is going on with the flat panels that we had planned to distribute to our gas logistics team.  It was in the budget and we had the okay, but now I'm hearing there is some hold-up & the units are stored on 44.

Thanks for your leadership on this issue.  The commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and I haven't made much headway with the GMS folks.  I'm glad you are involved!

I will be traveling out of the country next week.  Others from my staff will attend and I'll catch up when I return.

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Suzanne,
 
Next time you talk to Liz Gras would you pass along my phone number and email.  I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans.
 
I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together for court dates/travel.  One of the other Houston families (Swangos) has made progress on their dossier and turned in their INS approval.  The other (the Westbrooks) haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier.  I want to be very supportive and accomodate all the families -- after all the goal line is home for all these children.  At the same time, I need to form realistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family.  I think talking to Liz will be helpful on this front.
 
Thanks for all your help.  After you make the homestudy changes noted below you will resend to Gwyn?  Then she'll send to me to send to INS?  Probably sometime next week?
 
I'm planning to take a vacation day tomorrow -- and the type A person that I am, I'm just afraid that I'll miss some important action that I should be taking.  You can reach me on my cell at 713-857-2103 if you need to reach me tomorrow.

Shelley,
 
We will need to change the address and then get it all signed again.  It is good to know that the study overall meets their requirements.  This is probably going to take a few more days.  Still, it is better to have all of this taken care of now than to have someone send the study back.
 
Sorry for the delay. 
 
Suzanne

Dear Suzanne, 
I reviewed the homestudy you emailed to Ginger and it looks good.Please 
change the address for Across the World to :399 Taylor Boulevard,Suite 
102, 
Pleasant Hill, California 94523.That is the address for the main office in 
Calif. I did notice that MARITAL was spelled marial in the marital 
section. 
I'm sure your spellcheck probably caught it.I noticed that you mentioned 
the" Republic of Kazakhstan" quite a few times. I'm not sure if that is 
the 
correct name of the country. I will check and let you know if you need to 
change it.There is only one other thing that needs to be changed .It is 
located about the last paragraph of recommendation where you state that 
"the 
family is excited to experience the Russian culture".That statement would 
be 
very offensive to the Kazakhstan officials if you were to mention Russian 
culture. These people are not part of Russia-they are Kazakhstani- and a 
very proud people.So you could just change the word Russian to Kazakhstan. 
They do not like to be referred to as Russian.Let me know if you have any 
questions. I left you a message to call me but I don't think you need to 
call back unless you have questions. Please make sure that there is a 
current agency license at the back of the homestudy when the family sends 
their homestudy to me. I will be the one helping Ginger go thru everything 
so if you have questions feel free to call Ginger or me. 
Chris

I know that we are all under a lot of stress and I probably shouldn't send this note, but I just have to get this off my chest.  Have I done something to undermine your faith in me?  

- When I worked on due diligence matters, you asked me why was I working on due diligence
- When I prepared the demand letters you asked me why I was sending the demand letters
- And, today, despite the fact that we oversee the  day to day transactions, there is no mention of my group in the customer letter.

I wish someone would just fire me if I'm incompetent, because I live in a hell worse than being fired -- at least I'd have time for my family.

Except for this week, it is my understanding that it will be okay for us to use 42C1 if the meeting includes solely gas logistics staff that had security access to gas control.

A couple of thoughts

-  Per travelocity Lufthansa does fly between Houston-Frankfurt-Alma Ata & then Moscow-Frankfurt-IAH.  We'd only have to take
Transaero one way from Alma ata to Moscow.

- If we fly through Moscow on way to Kaz, keep in mind that the airport we fly into Moscow will be a totally different airport than the airport we fly from Moscow to Kaz (the regional airport).  I have heard that the regional airport is not a very safe or American friendly place.

- I want to me flexible on travel.  But, I'd really, really rather not fly on Aeroflot.

In reality, he was on a trip with some Gulf South folks & just returned to the office today.   He sent the attached memo and invoice this morning.  I was a bit off with my timing -- as September accounting close is tomorrow.  Thanks again for your help in resolving this matter.

Kevin,
We can get ETS-related pipe throughput for 2001 (and Rick has subsequently sent the TW 2001 data).  But we won't have non Enron pipeline throughput until they publish.

Unfortunately, I can only (immediately) help by providing throughput data for the Enron pipelines that was recently provided for another data request that covered the period 1996 - 2000.   It is attached below and has a tab for Transwestern.  The 2001 FERC Form 2 delivery data is not yet available since the Form 2 will not be completed until April 30, 2002.  Please let me know if you have difficulty finding the data elsewhere and I will ask the TW marketing or regulatory groups if they have any contacts.

Liz,

I'm not sure if we met either time at the Austin airport this summer.  My husband and I hosted 4-year old Alina, part of the same Taraz group as your child.   We miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home.  We're certainly not looking forward to travel at this time, and even less happy about leaving our 6-year old son home while we are out of country, but we are resolved to bring Alina home -- the sooner, the better.

Based on conversations with Ginger and Chris, it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time -- although I'm not sure when.

We have completed our dossier (although I haven't sent the originals to Ginger); completed our home study & sent into INS recently; and we've already done the INS fingerprinting.  So I guess the next steps are INS approval, shipping stuff off to Kazakstan, and getting our Kazakstan visas.

One of the hardest parts of the Kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return.  She is in the Ulan orphanage in Taraz.  Alina speaks only Kazak, no Russian, so I'm not sure how I'd communicate with her long distance even if I had an address or phone number.  Fortunately I have received periodic emails from Larissa, the escort that came to Houston with the children this summer.  Her husband, Sergei, has been to visit the children in Taraz & she sent me a picture of Alina.

Sorry to ramble so.  I'm anxious to talk to you about your child, your travel plans, possibilities for hiring an escort, etc.  Please feel free to call or email me anytime.  Here is my contact info.

SHelley: I feel AWFULLLL!!! What can I do? YOu are just about the best friend I have ever had in my whole life and I feel like I am absolutely falling short on supporting you right now. I am sorry about the wallet snatching - that is incredible --- How in the world could those charges  have occurred so quickly since it is the holidays, I would think that the cashiers are being extra careful. Anyway... I am glad that you are going on the trip; My mom and dad said that they are going to pray for you every day (they go to Mass now everyday at St. Joseph's Villa in Philly) - same with my sisters -- they have all been asking about you. Lunch really was great and was definitely needed by me! I am also sure by now you have heard the news about Cuba --- I am so sad about his passing - my understanding was that the chemo was working on his cancer (which had recurred from last year) but when he was supposed to be discharged, he came ! down with pneumonia and died shortly after. 

I will keep in touch with you via email and if there is ANYTHING I can do --- even wiring funds if you need it while you are travelling, let me know... 

Take care, 

Rosemary

I'm fine with not having Children's Church Palm Sunday -- recognizing that we won't have CC for 3 weeks then.  I'll adjust the curriculum notes accordingly and we'll pick up with Children's Church on April 14.

Upon further review with Frank regarding the alternate point usage on contract 23844 for the months of November '00, December '00, January '01, February '01 and March '01, it was determined there wasn't a violation.  MidAmerican is allowed 50,000 MMBtu/day delivered to alternate delivery points in association with contract 23844.  This information was overlooked at the time and since has been evaluated.  Please make the necessary corrections so that it is reflected that MEC did not have any alternate point use charges for those months .  If you need additional documentation, please let me know.
Thanks,
Courtney

Pam,

Thanks for all your help on the move/relocation.  I think you, Donna Scott & Jean McFarland have made the process of moving very efficient for all involved.  

On the longer range issue; however, I need to elevate my level of concern that the moves are having on customer service issues.  Since Tropical Storm Allison, ETS has experienced one computer system outage after another; including the virus problem the week before last.  This morning our scheduling system is out and we are having Internet problems -- both of which are impacting customer nominations.  During system outages it is imperative that gas logistics be able to mobilize and implement back-up plans to ensure customer transactions.  This is best handled by having a central staging area.

I realize these system reliablity problems have nothing to do with our moves or with the ultimate location of the Gas Logistics group.  Certainly I am pursuing these reliability concerns with Steve Hotte.  But, in light of these issues, I would like to talk about the timing & end state of where Gas Logistics is to be located and how long it is going to take to make this happen.   I know that your first priority of late has been to get us off 41.  Now that that has happened, I'd like to talk about the timing for which floor remodeling comes next (39, 42, etc) and the ramifications for my group.

I have heard back from Danny and he wants us to cancel the event.  Get whatever money back you can & see if we can forgo  any other current payments by postponing the event until next year, rather than canceling.

Subject:	RE: Final Review of FERC California Reporting - August 2001
Importance:	High

Mary Kay asked me to relay the following comments.  Elizabeth suggested I put them in an E-mail so that the Houston group could discuss sat 3:30.

1.  Item #1 PDT record (roughly page 109)
On TI contract #26849 for 8/18/2001-8/20/2001, report shows scheduled & delivered  volume of 1068 with NO nominated volume.
Elizabeth suspects that this was manually scheduled overrun.  
If that is the case, Mary Kay recommends that you make the Nominated column match the volume in the Scheduled column.

2.  Item #3 Footnote #3
Mary Kay suggested the following wording.  Do you agree that this describes what happened?
She is assuming that this was still related to the Force Majeur with Gallup being down, since Operating Capacity went down
from 8/19 to 8/20 then back up on 8/21.

"After operating for a day under the Force Majeure, physical mainline capacity was adjusted based on operating conditions."


- Rita

Alina's Dr. appt is at 10 in the medical center.  We'll have to have her go first at the dentist in case the dentist appointment runs long?

I was planning pasta for dinner.  I am not going to the Bunco game until 7 PM.

Chad should be in a really good mood -- since I put the treasure map in his lunch to find his post Stanford 9 Test present (Battletops) when he gets home.

Hi Cyndi,

Chad does not have soccer practice tonight so we are free to meet for
dinner pretty much anytime.  I know you are trying to tie up loose ends
at the office and I could stand to work a little late tonight.   How
does 7 PM at Cafe Express sound? 

 Kim, can you pick up Chad and meet me there?  Gaby says she may take
Chad to Lucas later this afternoon.  Please pay Gaby if you see her --
as I have given her the day off tomorrow.

Schedulers talking points on the separation of NNG/ENA


 

1.  NNG and ENA are entirely separate entities and our businesses are run entirely separate from one another.

2.  Customers may think that they can net ENA invoices against NNG invoices.  NNG is a separate business and is not responsible for ENA invoices to their customers.

3.  Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly.

4.  Creditworthiness status for ENA remains the responsibility of the Commercial Department. We are to maintain our normal course of business until instructed otherwise.

A couple of thoughts on the SoCalGas Complaint

1.  Perhaps you will want to emphasize this as being a computer system programming mistake -- not a billing mistake.  The point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlement and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.  The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.  

2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).

3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.  FERC let them re-bill customers for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.  I think this is a 2000 case.

One of my goals as ETS General Counsel is to assure that the group is organ=
ized in a way that allows all of us to provide quality services to our clie=
nts in the most efficient manner possible.  One of the ways to do this is t=
o modify our internal organization to better track the "functionalized" org=
anization that ETS has recently adopted in the operations and commercial ar=
eas.  Additionally, we must continually revisit the way we allocate our res=
ources to reflect client priorities.  Accordingly, I am pleased to announce=
 that Colleen Raker will begin reporting directly to me, effective immediat=
ely.  Richard Melton, Lee Huber and Kim Wilkie will report to Colleen.  Col=
leen's team will have primary responsibility for serving the "new business =
generation" efforts within Steve Hotte's IT group and Phil Lowry's Operatio=
ns group.  Additionally, Colleen's team will focus on asset purchase and sa=
le transactions and financings, while Colleen and Richard will take lead re=
sponsibility on pipeline security efforts led by Mike Nelson's team.  Each =
of these lawyers will also continue serving the numerous other clients they=
 assisted before this organizational change.

Lou Soldano's group will continue its emphasis on serving the needs of the =
rest of Phil Lowry's organization, including the key area of right of way a=
cquisition and other legal requirements related to pipeline expansions.  Gr=
eg Porter's group will continue its focus on   commercial and regulatory ac=
tivity on the NNG and TW systems.  Greg's group gets reinforcements on Mond=
ay, as Bill Rapp is joining us from EES.  Bill will focus on TW matters, an=
d will coordinate closely with Tony Pryor, Maria Pavlou, and Greg and Dot a=
s he gets up to speed on the busy TW docket.  Dot McCoppin's group will con=
tinue its role supporting all commercial and regulatory activity for Citrus=
/FGT.  Dot's group will also assist with TW matters as appropriate.

Given the dynamic business we are a part of and the small size of our group=
, the organizational structure outlined above is intended to be very flexib=
le.  Each of us will continue to be called on by clients to assist with pro=
jects that don't fit neatly into the above structure.  That is part of the =
challenge we face, but also part of the fun we enjoy! =20

Please join me in congratulating Colleen on her new responsibilities and in=
 welcoming Bill to the group on Monday! =20

Thanks looks good.  I guess I just have a chip on my shoulder these days about being relegated to the world of details!

Per discussion with Drew and Joe, here are some mods which I think mitigate our internal issue on an interactive open season and what that means.   Please provide any comments asap and then Robyn can take the document, unredline and submit to Staff for us.  Which should be doable today,   Mary Kay << File: TranswesternSettlementOffer1.doc >>

Here's what I'd like to do on this--we'll just take out the word
"interactive" in describing the open season we're proposing to use for
operational capacity.  I think Staff will come back and ask for an
interactive process, but we can address that issue when and if we get to
the next step.  Again, this initial offer is mostly designed to simply
get the process rolling and to flush Staff out on whether they are
serious or not.  We won't start putting meaning into the very broad
concepts in the outline unless Staff comes back with a serious interest
in settling.  Thanks.  df

Subject: RE: Restated 2002 CAPEX Plan


Don,
 
I would like to see the following notations added to the Gas Logistics CAPEX page to fully reflect the discussion and agreement.
 
With respect to the specific project listed:
 
1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.
 
 
With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:
 
2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.
 
3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.  
 
 
An additional footnote should be added to the page.
 
4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.

Rick,

When I was approving latest expense report I noticed an item listed Gulfstream project (lunch with Keith Higginbotham).  I have been working on Gulfstream OBA & interconnect agreement with Frazier/Dot/ Sharon for several weeks.  I didn't realize that you were working on Gulfstream items too.   What is your team working on on Gulfstream?

Also can I get a copy of the revised contract quick reference manual.  I think I had the outdated  one prior to the latest printing.

Thanks

Shelley

Ginger/Chris,

The Orphans petitions coordinator at the Houston INS office called this morning to say that our paperwork appeared in order and that she has an appointment to review our case with her supervisor this afternoon.  She said that we should receive the approval notification form within a week.

I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.  Tim - are these numbers verified and up to date.  Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.   It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.  

If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.

Subject: Question About Flat Stanley Project



Hi Ms. Traylor,

I gave my mom a heads up that "flat Stanley" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like
recent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological
terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's
email.

Hope all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school.  At first he expected to be 
coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month.
Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.

I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what Chad needs to develop.

While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted
a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look
like Alina and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.

Regards,

Shelley Corman  (Chad's Mom)

Hi Shel,

Did you say that "Flat Stanley" will arrive in a white envelope?  I received 
a yellow envelope in the mail today with no return address, my name & address 
were typed and it had a "non-profit" stamp on it.  I did not open it.  It's 
in the trash can but the garbage man doesn't go 'til Thursday... I can 
retrieve it if you think it might be the envelope from Chad.

Love,
Mom

Upon repressurizing the Station 13 yard piping it was discovered that the new side valve installed has a leak.  We have instructed the team to go ahead and try to resolve/fix this problem now.  The market continues to underburn and we will have no problems today making all deliveries while they continue to work at station 13.

The bad news is that if they can not resolve this valve problem today, then there is a strong possibility that we will have to do this outage again.

Gary Smith asked me to come by his office before noon.  I am in gas control now -- I stopped by your office with Connor.

The Phase V team has completed their work at Station 13.  Currently the operations crew at Station 13 is purging and packing the 30" mainline at Station 13 to the first valve section.  They are about one hour from completion.  We will return our mailine valves and horsepower to normal operating status when they are done.

The market only took a 1375 on the 1550 schedule; thus, we were able to keep the market well packed up, and we are in great position for making all deliveries again today.

FP&L only took 700 yesterday and they only want to target 720 today.  They have 783 scheduled today.  They had orginally nominated 850+ with the anticipation that they might lose some gas this weekend.  I think they are happy so far this weekend with our flexibility afforded to them.

I will email you when the line is completely turned back to us at Station 13.

If you are church, please do not respond to this email -- I would not want responisiblity for causing you to stumble into 
the sin of not listening to the sermon.

Hi Nancy

I have Alina at the Dr for her physical this afternoon, but we should be home by 6 PM and be home all evening.  Sorry I missed choir last night .  We are still transitioning and Alina had a fit as we were leaving a friend's house to come to choir.

We will continue to schedule transactions with ENA and other Enron affiliates in a business as normal fashion.  If ENA's supply is cut, then deliveries will be adjusted, just as we normally do.  

Bob Superty, Dir of ENA Gas Logistics has asked to be notified of any ENA supply cuts.  I'm not talking about nits and nats that are part of the normal confirmation process, rather, I'm talking about if a confirming party refuses to confirm a block of ENA gas.     We are notifying Bob as a courtesy and nothing about this added notice should hold up routine business processes.

You can leave Bob a voice message at x 3-0957 or call me and I'll call Bob.  In any event, I also would like to be briefed about any significant cuts in ENA or other Enron affiliate supply.

Thanks.  No-Notice Imbalances are market area from the perspective of commodity pricing.  The only reason that they are separated out from the rest of the imbalances is because of the transportation element of the cash-out price.

    Shelley,

         I was shut-out of the click-at-home program before I got a P.C. ordered and was wondering what the status, is on some of the surplus
computer equipment that is still in the building. I am guessing that there is some left of the same quality or better, than that offered in the
program. Maybe you could start a after Chrismas gift sale. Because it was my idea you could give me mine for free  Ha!

Galen/Jim,

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.


A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?

Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.


Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.

Hope you are doing well.
 
Any update on when Gwyn will sign and forward the homestudy?  I was hoping that I might be in a position to forward to the INS later this week.   I have all completed the rest of my dossier and am now focused on INS approval.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron?s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron?s Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron?s stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron?s remaining management team to direct the company?s ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world?s most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Dear Mr. _____________,
 
By prior correspondence dated ______, we notified you that we  you were notified of Ashford United Methodist Church's concern over the proEarlier this year AMaintenance of Houston currently provides janitorial service to Ashford United Methodist Church and Ashford Child Enrichment Center under a month to month contract.   Under this arrangement, Maintenance of Houston provides an on-site janitor.
 
In our initial correspondence soliciting janitorial service bids, we explained that our facility is used as a school during the week.  We explained the importance from a security perspective of minimizing the number of different people that have access to the facility.  We also asked Maintenance of Houston to provide documentation of employee screening procedures.
 
It has recently come to our attention that Maintenance of Houston has not furnished employee screening documentation for the individual that Maintenance of Houston currently has assigned to our facility.  It is our policy to request criminal background information for any contractor that is in our facility during school hours.
 
Please furnish such employee screening information to us by April 30, 2001.  To the extent Maintenance of Houston is unable to provide documentation for the current individual assigned to our facility or furnish another individual that does have appropriate documentation by April 30, 2001, we are hereby providing notice of our intent to terminate the month to month agreement effective May 31, 2001.
 
 
 
 
Sincerely
 
 
 
Shelley Corman, on behalf of
Ashford United Methodist Trustees

I'm not sure if you are the person I need to be contacting, so if you're not 
maybe you can lead me in the right direction.

I am in the process of working on a gas well in Hodgeman County, Kansas;
Section 18, T21S, R22W.  The BTU test for a well in the vicinity came back 
at 723BTU.  699.25 Methane, 14.64 Ethane, 4.77 Propane, 1.3 Isobutane, 0.98 
Normal Butane, 0.4 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 1.51 Hexanes.  Mole % is 
69.45 Methane, 0.83 Ethane, 0.19 Propane, 0.04 Isobutane, 0.03 Normal 
Butane, 0.01 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 0.03 Hexanes, 28.45 Nitrogen, 
0.04 Oxygen, 0 Carbon Dioxide, 0.93 Helium, and 0 Hydrogen.

Do you have a pipeline in the vicinity, and would you be able to purchase or 
transport the forementioned quality of gas.

If you could inform me on pipelines who could service this well please send 
me an e-mail.

Thank you.

Just got off the phone with the hotel.  If we postpone the event the cancellation fee still applies and fee cannot be used toward future events.  The cancellation fee consists of anticipated revenue, however, the hotel has agreed to gives us a 20% discount.

Anticipated Revenue:
		 Food:		$1,055.00
		 Drinks:	   $800.00
				$1,855.00

$1,855.00 with 20% Off =  $1,484.00
				 296.80   (20% service charge)
			          	 146.92   (8.25% Sales Tax)

If all of marketing is in agreement and we can demonstrate the elements sufficently to include in the filing.  How will this work in the field area??  Doesn't this conceptually give everyone the same priority or we narrowing it down to within the MID?  MK

In our meetings today on Order No. 637, we failed to discuss the topic of alternate point priorities "within-the-path". Marketing indicated in a meeting yesterday that they would like a change to alternate rights in the Market Area.  That change would provide that use of an alternate point within the operational zone where the shipper's primary rights are located would have priority over alternate rights in an operational zone where the shipper doesn't have primary.  This means we would have another level of alternate to be added to the tariff.  For example, if Minnegasco made an alternate nomination in Zone D at E.Dubuque, they would have a lower alternate right than Wisconsin Gas at E.Dubuque.
 
Please provide any comments you have on this issue along with your other comments requested to be provided to Maria by COB on Monday.  
 
p.s. I recognize this would fall into the category of "needing system changes so it may take awhile".

Jeffri,

I have received the revised W-2 forms from Enron that increases my reported income to reflect my non-eligibility to participate in the dependent daycare spending accounts.  (See letter in the package of information that I previously delivered to you).  Evidently Enron failed the test for providing dependent day care benefits to highly compensated employees.  I will fedex the revised W-2 forms to you.

I would like to set up a date (perhaps over the lunch hour one day) to meet at your office to review my return and to discuss alternatives for the second home (either rental or sale to my mother and/or her fianc?).

Good morning all.

Attached is the info that Esther helped me pull together for Rod last Wednesday. Rod told me over the weekend that he needs commodity volumes for these contracts for the years 1997-2000.  Help?  Can someone pull this together quickly for me?

Here is 1997-2000 TW Transportation Revenue by Contract, Sorted by Contract Expiration Date.  To get a breakdown of long-term/short-term, for each year I would include contracts that expire within the next year & IT as short term, with the remainder as LT.  For example, for 1997, I'd say that the revenues from contracts that expire on or before 12/31/98 + IT make up the short term revenues.

Kevin/Rod - One line item on the TW counterparty revenue summary probably requires explanation.  The report shows a net $4.2 million payment to PG&E for transportation.  This is because PG&E released capacity at rates in excess of the maximum rate due TW -- thus PG&E was due a credit.  This was not a liability to TW, as the other side of this capacity release is embedded in the revenues paid to TW by other counterparties.

Sorry I missed your call last week.  Kim misplaced your email address so I'm taking a stab that this is it.

I'd love to talk to you about your upcoming adventure to Kazakhstan.    Do you know where in Kazakhstan you'll be adopting from?

Happy New Year

I thought that you would enjoy reading this article about Chad's school.  My editorial notes are added in red.  Keeping watching www.houstonisd.org/bushes for when they post pictures of the event.

AWESOME VISIT
On Friday, October 19, President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush visited our school. The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of Afghanistan. Right in front of the entire student body, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $1, 147.00! The children were very impressed!
The day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our children were stellar! The program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school. Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement!
As the President and Mrs. Bush entered the stage, the children waved paper dollars in the air to greet them. The program opened with the singing of the school song. Carmen Sullivan gave a history of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and Kelly Iko (this is our Kelly from Sunday School -- whom I'm sure will be the first minority President of the United States)  led the group in the Pledge. The students sang God Bless America and waved individual flags. Not an eye was dry! It was awesome.
Maggie Strange, Julius Liu, Danny Siso and Brandi Shallenberger told the group about the effort the Bush students had put forth to collect money for the Afghan children. Doris Reese, Joan Zhang (this is a sweet little girl from Chad's class) , and Andrew Nelson wheeled in a red wagon with the students' contribution! The program closed with more flag waving and the singing of It's a Small World.

I copied the children's church materials yesterday and will have Gaby drop them off at church tomorrow.

We agreed to have a children's church meeting tacked on to the end of the next children's ministry meeting.

Would you please check to see that VBS is penciled in July 22-26 on the church calendar.

Thank you
Shelley (making good use of my jury duty time)

Hi, Ms. Corman.

This is Mrs. Jung.  This is my email if you ever need it for future
reference.  :)

Flat Stanley was sent in the envelopes provided from home.  I had the kids
put labels with the school's address on it in the return address corner.  I
also included an envelope with the school's address on it so that Stanleys
could be returned.  I'm glad to hear Stanleys are being anticipated.  I know
the kids are really excited about them.

I'm also glad to hear Chad's enjoying school.  We are definitely doing
harder work than Kindergarten.  We're actually doing different work than the
rest of first grade - more challenging, mind-stretching work, I'd like to
believe.

I was very encouraged by your letter and just wanted to express my
appreciation for sharing your thoughts with us.  Thanks again!  Let me know
if you have any other questions.


Sincerely,
Mrs. Jung

Fantastic.  Is Sheila planning to attend?  If so then, there are already 8 tickets committed.  If any of these cancel, I have a back-up list.

I will take 2 seats.  Please give me the invites for those two.  I'll take care of their transport.  They will not need Enron transport.

Catherine,

Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would be emailing you.   

This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.  

We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.

We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.

Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.  

In His Name,

Shelley Corman

Hi Shelley:
Perhaps we can talk tonight about several things I need to coordinate with 
you.
(1)  Children's Church schedule for December.  I talked to Steve Hoyle, and 
he did not have a preference one way or the other about Children's Church for 
the Cantata Sunday.  He did say the music program was rather long, with lots 
of dialogue.  I am inclined to say let's have C/C, and I can commit to being 
there.  Of course, we need at least 2 others to commit as well.  Since it 
would be rather long, I would be in favor of supplementing the C/C service 
with a Christmas-themed video.
(2)  Have you looked into food from McDonald's for the Christmas party?  I am 
working on the invite's, and tentatively am putting down on the RSVP card a 
meal preference of hamburgers or chicken nuggets (check one.)   That way, we 
can go either way with Happy Meals or just the basic food and fries, 
depending on cost, ease of packaging, etc.  Let me know what you think and if 
you need help with looking into this.
(3)  I saw some cute "Happy Birthday, Jesus" themed trinkets in the Oriental 
Trading catalog.  If you think we need more things for the treat bags, this 
is a possibility.  They also had a cute plastic treat bag with this theme 
that was fairly inexpensive.  (I can't remember if you said you already had 
bags or were still going to get them.)
I could talk tonight after 9:00, if that is convenient for you.
Thanks, Shelley!
Barbara

I am feeling pretty blue today with all the Enron stuff.  Finances being what they are -- we need to do some serious soul searching on Royal Oaks.  Can we get our money back if we walk or are we stuck.  Please also calculate the value of your Transocean options.  I may want to monetize these to cover adoption/travel expenses.

I know you were being nice and I am sorry.

I really can't put into words how it feels to get out of bed in the morning right now.  It takes me 1/2 hour to get myself together.  

I shouldn't have been so mean to you.  I know you were being nice.  I know this isn't a reasonable request, but these aren't reasonable times -- I just need some space when I'm getting ready in the morning.  

The heat and the fact that I couldn't have coffee this morning just put me over the edge.

My physical was ok.  Listen to this, because they are a preventive medicine shop he can't prescribe antibiotics.  So then, I couldn't get my travel vaccines, until I find out whether I have a sinus infection and need to be on antibiotics. 

Am I just dreaming these last few months or is this really my life?

Q,

I'm sorry about this morning.  I really was trying to be nice by making some
coffee and turning up the heat so it would be easier for you to get out of
bed.  How was your physical?  Did they give you an antibiotic?  Let me know.

Love Kim

I would be happy to do my usual Spring bedding flower planting, but I will be out of town on our Spring break trip on Sat.  Mar 9.  Please advise on whether you/the trustees would like me to add some new bedding plants around the trees, memorial and church entrance the following weekend on Mar 15.

Tonya,

Haven't heard from you in awhile and I am assuming that you were probably just burnt out over the flurry of summer activity.  All of my paperwork (including INS approval) is turned into Ginger and I am now just anxiously awaiting the opportunity to travel to Kazakhstan.  Ginger and crew are so busy that I imagine that things won't happen very fast.  

Not try to bother you if you had enough of this Kidsave stuff -- but on the other hand --- you worked hard to bring the kids here this summer and I just wanted to let you in on the fruits of your efforts.

Shelley

We had 22 kids and 3 adult helpers.  The kids were pretty wild.  It wasn't one of our better days.  Oh well!
 
If it's okay with you, I'd like to take a week break next weekend.  I need to be at an event downtown at 1 Pm and it would be nice not to rush.  I will bring you the boom box and CDs with music suggestions.  Would that be okay?
 
Also, Stan is not available the third weekend in November so I have agreed to switch with him.  He will teach Nov 11 (I will be there to help)  and I will take Nov 18 (Kim promises that he will definitely be there).

Toby,

Could you please take a look at the format of the outage postings.  Maybe I'm going at this the wrong way, but when I try to pull up a specific outage posting, I always get a whole set of outage postings.  For example when I try to pull up the chaim of postings related to the NNG MOPs 831 outage, I can't just pull up the specific posting, I also get other outages.  Why can't each outage posting be its own document?

will have more than an hour. Either way...I know I will be there.  Please 
know I am praying for you for strength and perseverance as you contine to be 
with Enron. I am sure things are not really comfortable right now but I sure 
am glad they have a wonderful light of Christ's witness like you to be among 
all the darkness.  My heart is still mourning the gentleman who ended his 
life. I pray there will be no one else. Alina grows in leaps and bounds each 
day. I see her at ACEC and she is pure delight. She yells a greeting to me 
when she sees me and it lights up my heart.  I am not sure what she is saying 
but we know each other and it really thrills me to see her smile and her 
little hand waving.  She is such a blessing!  Everyone shows her so much 
love. At Sunday school last week we all really gave Chad encouragment and 
affirmation that he is now the big brother.  He seemed pleased and a wee bit 
shy about all the attention.  Hope and pray we were not toooo much for him.  
Shelly, if you ever get stuck for someone to keep the kids for a while...I 
would be honored if my schedule permits.  Just wanted you to know! 
Thanks for all you do and are doing! I can't wait to begin beating the drum 
for VBS.
In Him,
Patty

Too much partying yesterday -- so I didn't finish my homework.  I'm still working on the slides and probably will be during the Commission meeting.  So I'll send them to you by 10:30 AM of so.  If you are available to edit them during a working lunch in my office let me know.

Hope your week is going well.  Here are a couple of things I wanted to tell you.

1.  I made the arrangements for the house rental, bought 8 baseball tickets each to two of the games where I thought day of the game seats would be hard to come by & got our airline tickets.

2.  Hopefully you got the invitation from Cyndi/Rosemary for Sat.  I know you have Karate plans that day so I understand if it doesn't suit you.  If you decide to come let me know though.  Grandpa is willing to come and stay with Chad (Kim will be in Indonesia), but I wanted to also see what D&T will be up to.

3. Does any day this week suit you for exercise - walk/run?

Thank you for your kind note.  Frankly with all the challenges our leadership team has faced this year, I don't have the slightest qualm that you and the other directors will  handle anything that comes our way.

Shelley,
 
I want you to know how happy I am for you being able to finally go to Kazakhstan and complete the adoption of your  daughter.  
 
While you are gone, please try to think about work and Enron as little as possible.  We will put in extra effort to ensure things go smoothly while you are out.  I will copy you on any important emails and data requests to give you something to read through when you get back to Houston.  
 
Enjoy your first new days of traveling with Aliana (sp).  I'm sure you both will be somewhat apprehensive about the travel arrangements and she will be looking towards you to see if she should be frightened.  On Sunday, I asked my Sunday school class to pray for your safety, for uncomplicated travel, and for patience while wading through the governmental red tape.  My family and I will be thinking about you and your family over the holidays.
 
Rick

Hi, Ms. Corman.

This is Mrs. Jung.  This is my email if you ever need it for future
reference.  :)

Flat Stanley was sent in the envelopes provided from home.  I had the kids
put labels with the school's address on it in the return address corner.  I
also included an envelope with the school's address on it so that Stanleys
could be returned.  I'm glad to hear Stanleys are being anticipated.  I know
the kids are really excited about them.

I'm also glad to hear Chad's enjoying school.  We are definitely doing
harder work than Kindergarten.  We're actually doing different work than the
rest of first grade - more challenging, mind-stretching work, I'd like to
believe.

I was very encouraged by your letter and just wanted to express my
appreciation for sharing your thoughts with us.  Thanks again!  Let me know
if you have any other questions.


Sincerely,
Mrs. Jung

Here is my two cents...

From your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches 
overhang the condominium fence.  If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.  

The condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on
our property or destroy the tree.  

A landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is
obstructing a public road.   A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.  Since
the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a "negligence" issue.
Further, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm 
unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.  

If the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a "nuisance" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.  Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.

Bottom Line:  We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down.

Subject: Cutting Trees & Brush along our fence 


Greetings:

I spoke with Connie of Hunter's Point condominiums who asked that if they
could cut the trees and bushes along the fence line we share.
She said its on our property and thought that we should cut it since it is
on our property and blocking the view of the residents of the complex.

Advised her that it is currentl y not a problem for us and if Hunter's
Point trim the trees and bushes they must clean up any cutting and not
leave them on our property. Connie advised she would check with their
landscape company and advise.

Shelley, can you advise if we are required by any law to trim the trees and
bushes which block the view of an adjoining resident, I guess for good
neighbor policy and as we are a church we could do our civic duty, this
also raises the question, if we are blocking their view now, what happens
when we build the new Sanctuary and they have a problem with our roof
blocking their view?

Thanks/Regards

No, we live about 2-3 mi. off I-10.  It is really easy to get to our house from Austin by taking 71 to I-10 east. 


Here is a turn by turn:

Exit 1-10 at Highway 6 (17 mi. West of Downtown Houston).  

Go South on Hwy 6 to the 3rd stop light (Chevron station on SE corner).  Take right onto Briarforest Drive.  Take first left onto Briarhome (Meadowbriar subdivision).  We live on Scarborough Fair -- third street off Briarhome.  Our home is 2-story red brick & is in the NE corner.

Also last night I emailed Sergei a brief note regarding what Ginger was telling us yesterday. I didn't want to jump ranks or push him for an earlier date -- but I wanted to make certain that he knew that all our paperwork is in.

Welcome back! I was wondering if you had 30 minutes today to discuss NNG's major customers from a strategic perspective.  Stan has asked me (on a very confidential basis) to explore various "buy back" options for NNG, including raising a lot of money!  I wanted to get your thoughts on certain customers' willingness to participate in an ownership interest in NNG.  I did not want to meet with Dave and his team given the Dynegy transition. I am free all morning except at 9 and this afternoon except from 2 to 4.
