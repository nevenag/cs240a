Subject	True Story      FW The below is a true story -- It was on TV and in the         Readers Digest         Importance High                              The 26-year-old mother stared down at her son who was            dying of terminal leukemia Although her heart was            filled with sadness she also had a strong feeling of            determination Like any parent she wanted her son to            grow up and fulfill all his dreams Now that was no            longer possible The leukemia would see to that But            she still wanted her sons dreams to come true She            took her sons hand and asked Billy did you ever            think about what you wanted to be once you grew up            Did you ever dream and wish what you would do with            your life            Mommy I always wanted to be a fireman when I grew            up Mom smiled back and said Lets see if we can            make your wish come true Later that day she went            to her local fire department in Phoenix Arizona            where she met Fireman Bob who had a heart as big as            Phoenix She explained her sons final wish and            asked if it might be possible to give her six-year-           old son a ride around the block on a fire engine            Fireman Bob said Look we can do better than that            If youll have your son ready at seven oclock            Wednesday morning well make him an honorary fireman            for the whole day He can come down to the fire            station eat with us go out on all the fire calls            the whole nine yards And if youll give us his            sizes well get a real fire uniform for him            with a real fire hat-not a toy one-with the emblem            of the Phoenix Fire Department on it a yellow slicker            like we wear and rubber boots Theyre all            manufactured right here in Phoenix so we can get them            fast            Three days later Fireman Bob picked up Billy dressed            him in his fire uniform and escorted him from his            hospital bed to the waiting hook and ladder truck            Billy got to sit on the back of the truck and help            steer it back to the fire station He was in heaven            There were three fire calls in Phoenix that day and            Billy got to go out on all three calls He rode in            the different fire engines the paramedics van and            even the fire chiefs car He was also videotaped            for the local news program            Having his dream come true with all the love and            attention that was lavished upon him so deeply            touched Billy that he lived three months longer            than any doctor thought possible One night all of            his vital signs began to drop dramatically and the            head nurse who believed in the hospice concept that            no one should die alone began to call the family            members to the hospital            Then she remembered the day Billy had spent as a   fireman            so she called the Fire Chief and asked if it would be            possible to send a fireman in uniform to the hospital   to            be with Billy as he made his transition            The chief replied We can do better than that Well   be            there in five minutes Will you please do me a favor            When you hear the sirens screaming and see the lights            flashing will you announce over the PA system that   there            is not a fire Its just the fire department coming to   see            one of its finest members one more time And will you            open the window to his room About five minutes later a            hook and ladder truck arrived at the hospital extended            its ladder up to Billys third floor open window and 16            firefighters climbed up the ladder into Billys room            With his mothers permission they hugged him and held            him and told him how much they loved him            With that Billy looked up and said Chief am I really            a fireman now Billy you are and the Head Chief   Jesus            is holding your hand The chief said With those   words            Billy smiled and said I know Hes been holding my   hand            all day and the angels have been singing He closed            his eyes one last time            My instructions were to send this to four people that I            wanted God to bless and I picked you Please pass this            to four people you want to be blessed as well as the   person            who sent it to you This story is powerful and there is            nothing attached please do not break this pattern            uplifting stories are one of the best gifts we receive            There is no cost but a lot of rewards lets continue   to            uplift one another God bless you and have a nice day

didnt believe in God and he 20 didnt hesitate to let others know how he felt about religion and 20 religious holidays like Christmas His wife however did20 believe and she raised their children to also  have faith in20 God and Jesus despite  his disparaging comments  20 20 One snowy Christmas Eve his wife was taking  their children20 to a Christmas Eve service in the farm  community in which they20 lived  She  asked him to come but he refused 20 20 That story is nonsense he said Why would  God lower20 Himself to come to Earth as a man  Thats ridiculous So20 she and the children left  and he stayed home  20 20 A while later the winds grew stronger and the  snow turned20 into a blizzard  As the man  looked out the window all he20 saw was a blinding snowstorm   He sat down to relax before 20 the fire for the evening Then he heard  a loud thump  20 Something had hit the window Then another  thump He  20 looked out but couldnt see  more than a few feet When the20 snow let up a little he ventured  outside to see what could20 have been beating on  his window  In the field near his20 house he saw a flock of wild geese Apparently  they had been20 flying south for the winter when they got  caught in the snowstorm 20 and couldnt go on They were lost and  stranded on his farm with no20 food or shelter They just flapped  their wings and flew around the field 20 in low circles blindly and  aimlessly A couple of them had flown into20 his window it  seemed20 20 The man felt sorry for the geese and wanted to  help them The barn20 would  be a great place for them to stay  he thought Its warm and safe 20 surely they could spend the night  and wait out the storm So he walked ove r to20 the barn and  opened the doors wide then watched and waited hoping they  20 would notice the open barn and go inside But the geese just  fluttered aro und20 aimlessly and didnt seem to notice the barn or  realize what it could mean 20 for them  The man tried to get  their attention but that just seemed to s care20 them and they  moved further away He went into the house and came with  so me20 bread broke it up and made a breadcrumbs trail leading to  the barn  The y20 still didnt catch on20 20 Now he was getting frustrated He got behind  them and tried to shoo them 20 toward the barn but they only got more scared  and scattered in every20 direction except toward the barn Nothing he  did could get them to go into 20 the barn where they would be warm  and safe Why dont they follow me  20 he exclaimed  Cant they see this is the only place where they  can survi ve20 the storm He thought for a moment and realized  that they just wouldnt f ollow20 a human If only I were a  goose then I could save them he said out lou d 20 Then  he had an idea He went into barn got one of his own geese and carr ied it  in his  arms as he circled around behind the flock of  wild   geese   He then released it His goose flew through the flock and  straight into the barn--and one by one the other geese followed it to  safety  20 He stood silently for a moment as the words he  had spoken a few minutes ea rlier replayed in his mind If only I were  a goose then I  could save th em Then he thought about what he  had said to his wife earlier 20 20 Why would God want to be like us Thats  ridiculous  20 20 Suddenly it all made sense That is what God  had done We were like the20 geese--blind lost perishing God had His Son  become like us so He could 20 show us the way and save us That was  the meaning of Christmas he realize d 20 As the winds and blinding snow died down his soul became quiet 20 and pondered this wonderful thought Suddenly he understood what  Christmas was20 all about why Christ had come    Years  of doubt and disbelief20 vanished like the passing storm He fell to his knees in the snow and  pra yed his first  prayer Thank You God for coming in human form to  get me out of the storm 20 ---Author unknown
