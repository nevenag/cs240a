Susan Avera-Roth Mike Stephens Rhonda Lawrence Rex Carleton Jenny Smith Paula Raeke Subject Violence On Saturday Sept 22 2001 at approximately 147 am I was awaken by the sounds of a car crash  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bedroom window at Hwy 36 I saw nothing and went back to bed and fell asleep  At approximately 245 am I was awaken by the sounds of a man outside my bedroom window requesting an ambulance for someone cut up pretty bad  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bathroom window I saw a police officer outside with a flash light  I woke Keith up to tell him the police were in our yard  Keith dressed and went out the front door  The officer told Keith to get back inside because an armed suspect was running around our home  Keith came back inside and told me what was going on  After checking on Andrew we went into Chasitys vacant bedroom and looked out the window into the backyard  Men with flash lights police cars with spot lights were all over our yard Finally the suspect was spotted behind the pecan tree closes to our house  The officers drew their guns and ordered the suspect to surrender  Since the suspect would not cooperate an officer shouted several times that he was going to shoot  This was not something I wanted to witness so I quit looking out the window  Keith told me that he surrendered and that they had him in custody  An officer starting knocking on our front door  As I opened the door I informed the officer that my husband would be right there  Keith went outside to talk to the officer  I looked out my living room window and saw my driveway full of police cars followed by an ambulance  Hwy 36 and Meadow Lane were full of police cars with their spot lights pointed toward our house  Keith came inside and informed me that Buccees in Brazoria had been robbed and a young lady had been abducted the ambulance was for her and the suspect didnt have a gun but was carrying a knife  Keith informed me that I did hear a crash and that the truck they were in is laying on its passenger side on the other side of our barn  The police were outside video taping our front yard treating it as a crime scene  Once the police took off with the suspect and the ambulance transported the victim Keith talked me into going outside and looking at the crash  By this time a wrecker was at the scene  We watched the wrecker driver pull the truck back onto all four tires and haul it away On Sunday morning at approximately 230 am I woke up and started listening for a re-run of the events that took place 24 hours earlier Once I realized that my home was safe I went back to sleep With a troubled mind I realized that I did not know how to deal with violence I called my brother-in-law Rev Dale Frankum for answers Dale suggested I read the book of Psalm  Gladys suggested particularly Chapter 91  After reading Psalm 914 He will cover you with his feathers and under his wings you will find refuge his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart I found peace of mind  I now know that He put me back to bed instead of me searching for an answer to the crash that woke me up which put a violent man outside my home  And He kept my son in a deep sleep so that Andrew would not witness the horror that was going on right outside his bedroom window  At this time all Andrew knows is that someone had a wreck in our front yard I would like to spare him from the rest of the story As our country heals from the events of Sept 11 2001 and as we continue to fear more terrorist attacks I suggest you read the book of Psalm to find peace of mind because He is our refuge My God Bless you your family and America Nancy Stephens This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and

process continue  Thanks Patrick Tucker x3-3055 -----Original Message-----From Bransgrove Alan mailtoAlanBransgrovexemktcom Sent Friday November 09 2001 934 AM To Tucker Patrick Cc Carter Tim Ishee Jeff Subject ENFOLIO Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement with Northern States Power Company Patrick At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced Agreement for Northern States Power Company NSP  I apologize for the delay  Our comments are as follows Northern States Power Company Agreement Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues  We request in Section 41 that the 50000000 dollar level be applicable to each of our companies  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section 47 be increased to 25000000 as to each of our companies 24 Confirmations  In the second line please change may to shall  We need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for regulatory purposes  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed and returned in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 221 Transactions 35 Netting and 44 Offset  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in the normal course of business under these contracts  Amounts due to and from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSP acts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction  Accordingly we propose that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement 41 Early Termination  I am concerned that the date to be established for termination of Transactions is without definition  I would prefer to see the language in subpart i modified to state that the Notifying Party may establish a date which shall be not less than two 2 nor more than ten 10 Business Days following the date of such notice 42 Triggering Event  In the 8th line down I dont understand the inclusion of the phrase or deemed to be repeated  Unless I am missing something it doesnt make sense with the rest of the sentence  Please delete this phrase in the Agreement 41 and 45 References to Affiliates  In numerous places throughout the Agreements and in particular in Sections 41 and 45 reference is made to Affiliates  For regulatory reasons we cannot intermingle the account status of our affiliated companies  Moreover NSP is not authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated  Please delete all references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement Article 5 Force Majeure  The language in this Article is not typical of most Force Majeure provisions which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period  The language in your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time only for a duration of up to 60 Days after which time Force Majeure no longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement  In other words Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence involving a separate and independent Transaction  This is not acceptable We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments Section 81 Notices  Prior to the language in the parenthetical please insert provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically Section 82  Transfer  We would prefer that this language be revised to the more traditional language requiring the consent rather than approval of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld Please modify this provision accordingly Section 83  Limitation of Remedies  We are in general agreement with this provision however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use  The gas sold and purchased under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the ordinary use to which it is intended  Please modify this Section accordingly Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions  The GISB Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day confirm deadline rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition  We request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry standard Definition of Material Adverse Change  This definition needs to be expanded beyond a review of the level of each companys credit rating  Please replace your definition with the following Material Adverse Change with respect to a Party means i any downgrading of any unsecured long-term senior debt of such Party 	or any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit support for the obligations of such Party each such entity being a Credit Support Provider for such Party such that such debt is rated below BBB- or its equivalent by Standard  Poors or below Baa3 or its equivalent by Moodys Investor Services Inc 	provided that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any unsecured long-term senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard  Poors or Moodys Investor Services Inc then a 	Material Adverse Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which in the reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness 	financial responsibility or ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider as applicable to perform its obligations in connection 	herewith Definition of Replacement Price Differential  Although we are in general agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential it seems preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable cost of cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred Please modify your definition accordingly Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreement consistent with our comments as set forth above  Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes you may contact me via return e-mail or at the phone number

Bransgrove Alan mailtoAlanBransgrovexemktcom Sent Friday November 09 2001 934 AM To Tucker Patrick Cc Carter Tim Ishee Jeff Subject ENFOLIO Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement with Northern States Power Company Patrick At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced Agreement for Northern States Power Company NSP  I apologize for the delay  Our comments are as follows Northern States Power Company Agreement Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues  We request in Section 41 that the 50000000 dollar level be applicable to each of our companies  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section 47 be increased to 25000000 as to each of our companies 24 Confirmations  In the second line please change may to shall  We need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for regulatory purposes  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed and returned in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 221 Transactions 35 Netting and 44 Offset  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in the normal course of business under these contracts  Amounts due to and from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSP acts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction  Accordingly we propose that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement 41 Early Termination  I am concerned that the date to be established for termination of Transactions is without definition  I would prefer to see the language in subpart i modified to state that the Notifying Party may establish a date which shall be not less than two 2 nor more than ten 10 Business Days following the date of such notice 42 Triggering Event  In the 8th line down I dont understand the inclusion of the phrase or deemed to be repeated  Unless I am missing something it doesnt make sense with the rest of the sentence  Please delete this phrase in the Agreement 41 and 45 References to Affiliates  In numerous places throughout the Agreements and in particular in Sections 41 and 45 reference is made to Affiliates  For regulatory reasons we cannot intermingle the account status of our affiliated companies  Moreover NSP is not authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated  Please delete all references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement Article 5 Force Majeure  The language in this Article is not typical of most Force Majeure provisions which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period  The language in your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time only for a duration of up to 60 Days after which time Force Majeure no longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement  In other words Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence involving a separate and independent Transaction  This is not acceptable We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments Section 81 Notices  Prior to the language in the parenthetical please insert provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically Section 82  Transfer  We would prefer that this language be revised to the more traditional language requiring the consent rather than approval of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld Please modify this provision accordingly Section 83  Limitation of Remedies  We are in general agreement with this provision however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use  The gas sold and purchased under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the ordinary use to which it is intended  Please modify this Section accordingly Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions  The GISB Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day confirm deadline rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition  We request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry standard Definition of Material Adverse Change  This definition needs to be expanded beyond a review of the level of each companys credit rating  Please replace your definition with the following Material Adverse Change with respect to a Party means i any downgrading of any unsecured long-term senior debt of such Party 	or any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit support for the obligations of such Party each such entity being a Credit Support Provider for such Party such that such debt is rated below BBB- or its equivalent by Standard  Poors or below Baa3 or its equivalent by Moodys Investor Services Inc 	provided that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any unsecured long-term senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard  Poors or Moodys Investor Services Inc then a 	Material Adverse Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which in the reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness 	financial responsibility or ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider as applicable to perform its obligations in connection 	herewith Definition of Replacement Price Differential  Although we are in general agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential it seems preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable cost of cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred Please modify your definition accordingly Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreement consistent with our comments as set forth above  Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes you may contact me via return e-mail or at the phone number listed below Thank you for your consideration  I look forward to working with you to finalize this Agreement

Modifications for Parental GuaranteeDocument link Rob Smith Rob I have made a few changes and one correction  I deleted the reference to must pay within 5 business days added to paragraph 3  If Enron does make a demand under this guaranty there is no way we can make payment within those 5 days especially since we will need to rely on an outside party to provide data to us  As you know however when we receive a demand under a guaranty we move quickly to verify the request and make payments where appropriate I completed the information in paragraph 4a I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate authority Finally I reinserted excluding choice of law provisions     language to try to keep the case under Texas law assuming a dispute ever arises All told most of the changes look fine Thanks Ernie See attached file Dyn to Enron 1doc Rob Smith To     Ernie KohnkeHOUDynegyDynegy 092401             cc     Thomas WhiteHOUDynegyDynegy 1115 AM             Subject

Lawrence Rex Carle ton Jenny Smith Paula Raeke Subject Violence 20 On Saturday Sept 22 2001 at approximately 147 am I was awaken by the sounds of a car crash  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bedroom w indow at Hwy 36 I saw nothing and went back to bed and fell asleep  At ap proximately 245 am I was awaken by the sounds of a man outside my bedro om window requesting an ambulance for someone cut up pretty bad  As I jump ed out of bed and looked out my bathroom window I saw a police officer out side with a flash light  I woke Keith up to tell him the police were in ou r yard  Keith dressed and went out the front door  The officer told Keith to get back inside because an armed suspect was running around our home   Keith came back inside and told me what was going on  After checking on An drew we went into Chasitys vacant bedroom and looked out the window into  the backyard  Men with flash lights police cars with spot lights were all over our yard  Finally the suspect was spotted behind the pecan tree clo ses to our house  The officers drew their guns and ordered the suspect to  surrender  Since the suspect would not cooperate an officer shouted sever al times that he was going to shoot  This was not something I wanted to  witness so I quit looking out the window  Keith told me that he surrender ed and that they had him in custody  An officer starting knocking on our f ront door  As I opened the door I informed the officer that my husband wo uld be right there  Keith went outside to talk to the officer  I looked o ut my living room window and saw my driveway full of police cars followed b y an ambulance  Hwy 36 and Meadow Lane were full of police cars with their spot lights pointed toward our house  Keith came inside and informed me t hat Buccees in Brazoria had been robbed and a young lady had been abducted  the ambulance was for her and the suspect didnt have a gun but was carr ying a knife  Keith informed me that I did hear a crash and that the truck they were in is laying on its passenger side on the other side of our barn   The police were outside video taping our front yard treating it as a cr ime scene  Once the police took off with the suspect and the ambulance tra nsported the victim Keith talked me into going outside and looking at the  crash  By this time a wrecker was at the scene  We watched the wrecker d river pull the truck back onto all four tires and haul it away 20 On Sunday morning at approximately 230 am I woke up and started listeni ng for a re-run of the events that took place 24 hours earlier  Once I rea lized that my home was safe I went back to sleep 20 20 With a troubled mind I realized that I did not know how to deal with viol ence I called my brother-in-law Rev Dale Frankum for answers  Dale su ggested I read the book of Psalm  Gladys suggested particularly Chapter 91   After reading Psalm 914 He will cover you with his feathers and under his wings you will find refuge his faithfulness will be your shield and r ampart I found peace of mind  I now know that He put me back to bed ins tead of me searching for an answer to the crash that woke me up which put a violent man outside my home  And He kept my son in a deep sleep so that A ndrew would not witness the horror that was going on right outside his bedr oom window  At this time all Andrew knows is that someone had a wreck in  our

Susan Avera-Roth Mike Stephens Rhonda Lawrence Rex Carleton Jenny Smith Paula Raeke Subject Violence On Saturday Sept 22 2001 at approximately 147 am I was awaken by the sounds of a car crash  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bedroom window at Hwy 36 I saw nothing and went back to bed and fell asleep  At approximately 245 am I was awaken by the sounds of a man outside my bedroom window requesting an ambulance for someone cut up pretty bad  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bathroom window I saw a police officer outside with a flash light  I woke Keith up to tell him the police were in our yard  Keith dressed and went out the front door  The officer told Keith to get back inside because an armed suspect was running around our home  Keith came back inside and told me what was going on  After checking on Andrew we went into Chasitys vacant bedroom and looked out the window into the backyard  Men with flash lights police cars with spot lights were all over our yard Finally the suspect was spotted behind the pecan tree closes to our house  The officers drew their guns and ordered the suspect to surrender  Since the suspect would not cooperate an officer shouted several times that he was going to shoot  This was not something I wanted to witness so I quit looking out the window  Keith told me that he surrendered and that they had him in custody  An officer starting knocking on our front door  As I opened the door I informed the officer that my husband would be right there  Keith went outside to talk to the officer  I looked out my living room window and saw my driveway full of police cars followed by an ambulance  Hwy 36 and Meadow Lane were full of police cars with their spot lights pointed toward our house  Keith came inside and informed me that Buccees in Brazoria had been robbed and a young lady had been abducted the ambulance was for her and the suspect didnt have a gun but was carrying a knife  Keith informed me that I did hear a crash and that the truck they were in is laying on its passenger side on the other side of our barn  The police were outside video taping our front yard treating it as a crime scene  Once the police took off with the suspect and the ambulance transported the victim Keith talked me into going outside and looking at the crash  By this time a wrecker was at the scene  We watched the wrecker driver pull the truck back onto all four tires and haul it away On Sunday morning at approximately 230 am I woke up and started listening for a re-run of the events that took place 24 hours earlier Once I realized that my home was safe I went back to sleep With a troubled mind I realized that I did not know how to deal with violence I called my brother-in-law Rev Dale Frankum for answers Dale suggested I read the book of Psalm  Gladys suggested particularly Chapter 91  After reading Psalm 914 He will cover you with his feathers and under his wings you will find refuge his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart I found peace of mind  I now know that He put me back to bed instead of me searching for an answer to the crash that woke me up which put a violent man outside my home  And He kept my son in a deep sleep so that Andrew would not witness the horror that was going on right outside his bedroom window  At this time all Andrew knows is that someone had a wreck in our front yard I would like to spare him from the rest of the story As our country heals from the events of Sept 11 2001 and as we continue to fear more terrorist attacks I suggest you read the book of Psalm to find peace of mind because He is our refuge My God Bless you your family and America Nancy Stephens This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and

Jeff Subject ENFOLIO Master Firm PurchaseSale Agreement with Northern States Power Company Patrick At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced Agreement for Northern States Power Company NSP  I apologize for the delay  Our comments are as follows Northern States Power Company Agreement Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues  We request in Section 41 that the 50000000 dollar level be applicable to each of our companies  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section 47 be increased to 25000000 as to each of our companies 24 Confirmations  In the second line please change may to shall  We need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for regulatory purposes  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed and returned in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 221 Transactions 35 Netting and 44 Offset  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in the normal course of business under these contracts  Amounts due to and from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSP acts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction  Accordingly we propose that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement 41 Early Termination  I am concerned that the date to be established for termination of Transactions is without definition  I would prefer to see the language in subpart i modified to state that the Notifying Party may establish a date which shall be not less than two 2 nor more than ten 10 Business Days following the date of such notice 42 Triggering Event  In the 8th line down I dont understand the inclusion of the phrase or deemed to be repeated  Unless I am missing something it doesnt make sense with the rest of the sentence  Please delete this phrase in the Agreement 41 and 45 References to Affiliates  In numerous places throughout the Agreements and in particular in Sections 41 and 45 reference is made to Affiliates  For regulatory reasons we cannot intermingle the account status of our affiliated companies  Moreover NSP is not authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated  Please delete all references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement Article 5 Force Majeure  The language in this Article is not typical of most Force Majeure provisions which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period  The language in your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time only for a duration of up to 60 Days after which time Force Majeure no longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement  In other words Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence involving a separate and independent Transaction  This is not acceptable We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments Section 81 Notices  Prior to the language in the parenthetical please insert provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically Section 82  Transfer  We would prefer that this language be revised to the more traditional language requiring the consent rather than approval of the other Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld Please modify this provision accordingly Section 83  Limitation of Remedies  We are in general agreement with this provision however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use  The gas sold and purchased under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the ordinary use to which it is intended  Please modify this Section accordingly Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions  The GISB Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day confirm deadline rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition  We request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry standard Definition of Material Adverse Change  This definition needs to be expanded beyond a review of the level of each companys credit rating  Please replace your definition with the following Material Adverse Change with respect to a Party means i any downgrading of any unsecured long-term senior debt of such Party 	or any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit support for the obligations of such Party each such entity being a Credit Support Provider for such Party such that such debt is rated below BBB- or its equivalent by Standard  Poors or below Baa3 or its equivalent by Moodys Investor Services Inc 	provided that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any unsecured long-term senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard  Poors or Moodys Investor Services Inc then a 	Material Adverse Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which in the reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness 	financial responsibility or ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider as applicable to perform its obligations in connection 	herewith Definition of Replacement Price Differential  Although we are in general agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential it seems preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable cost of cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred Please modify your definition accordingly Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreement consistent with our comments as set forth above  Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes you may contact me via return e-mail or at the phone number listed below Thank you for your consideration  I look forward to working with you to finalize this Agreement
