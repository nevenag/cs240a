       the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work -        that I was making jobapplications by company email Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment As a manager Mr Bezanis has -        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval -        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance PRC process which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers and clients by review  Until now Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results -        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an energy index as a potential useful trading instrument  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite but the reaction of Mr Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first  I was banned by him from developing the idea further Discrimination It is our belief that Mr Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees especially competent women as equals  His rough stifling and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms Courtney Campbell the other only woman reporting to him Hostile Working Environment The working environment under Mr Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence  We are managed by threats rather than constructive comments Wrongful Termination Knowing I was unfairly treated Enron HR has not helped address my concerns  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process  Ms Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers no matter how wrong they are  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case Yours sincerely Mingcheng Lian

status  Through affirmative action we seek to establish a level playing field for all employees and applicants regardless of race gender disability or veteran status  We use statistical analyses of employment patterns as indicators of whether the playing field is truly level The AAP contains proprietary information therefore it should not be shared with anyone outside of Enron  If your operating

Please refer to Enrons Code of Ethics book for guidance concerning your obligations of confidence with proprietary company information Although the AAP contains proprietary information and belongs to

regard to race color religion age sex national origin disability or veteran status  All employee selections are based on 1 inclusive recruitment and outreach efforts and the merit qualifications and competence of individuals for the particular positions and 2 consistently providing equal employment opportunity  We believe that a diverse workforce is a strength and that as we implement personnel policies and practices which foster fair treatment on the basis of race sex and disability we promote equitable employment opportunities for all employees and applicants Enron administers all personnel programs and employment opportunities without regard to race color religion age sex pregnancy national origin physical or mental disability veteran status or status as an alien authorized to work in the United States  Such employment programs and opportunities include but are not limited to compensation benefits transfers layoff leaves of absence return from layoff training education tuition assistance and Company-sponsored social and recreational programs We have developed and implemented the 2001 Affirmative Action Program AAP to support our commitment to the principle of equal employment opportunity and meet federal and state requirements  The AAP describes in detail the policies and procedures used in the Companys operations to carry out its commitment Your companys EEO

legal clarification requested Pam Just to make sure we are clear on our end what you are saying is that the  grantee would be considered an Enron employee under common law under the st andards set forth in Question 1b in FIN 44 as follows A grantee is an employee if the grantor exercises or has the right to exer cise sufficient control over that individual to establish an employer-emplo yee relationship That relationship shall be determined based on common law as illustrated in case law and currently under US Internal Revenue Servi ce Revenue Ruling 87-41 Accordingly for purposes of applying Opinion 25  a grantee meets the definition of an employee if the grantor consistently r epresents that individual to be an employee under common law The definitio n of an employee for payroll tax purposes under the US Internal Revenue C ode includes common law employees Accordingly a grantor that classifies a grantee potentially subject to US payroll taxes as an employee under Opi nion 25 must also except as provided in paragraph 6 represent that indivi dual as an employee for payroll tax purposes A grantee does not meet the d efinition of an employee under Opinion 25 solely because the grantor repres ents that individual as an employee for some but not all purposes For ex ample a requirement or decision to classify a grantee as an employee for U S payroll tax purposes does not by itself indicate that the grantee is  an employee for purposes of Opinion 25 because the grantee must also be an  employee of the grantor under common law We will base part of our conclusion on the answer we are provided Thanks f or the clarification in advance Tracy A Tyler Manager20 Enron Corporate Transaction Support direct 713-345-2860 mobile 832-651-3121 -----Original Message-----From 09Butler Pam 20 Sent09Monday July 16 2001 434 PM To09Tyler Tracy Cc09Farmer Stanley Subject09RE Question on stock grants -

are currently setting up a similar meeting with PurchasePro Com Inc  We have also targeted several other companies that may be interested in buying DealBench and will be discussing the opportunity with them in the near future Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification as it relates to your questions below Regards Ross Mesquita x3-3288 -----Original

of Ethics Dealbench Importance	High Dear Brad and Michelle I have reviewed the letter from Tobias Munk Has Enron determined that it will no longer be involved with DealBenchcom and given permission to allow Mr Munk to independently raise funds for a proposed management buy-out or sale to an independent third party  or Has Enron determined that it will not go forward with DealBenchcom at this time but it is possible in the future that it will still be involved with DealBenchcom  I note that Mr Munk states that Enron is actively seeking a buyer for the platform  What discussions have taken place with respect to a transaction for the purchase of DealBenchcom Regardless of Mr Munks intentions as stated in his letter of August 7 2001 Enron must make a determination to allow Mr Munk to use Enrons idea etc for DealBenchcom as it is proprietary and belongs to Enron and not Mr Munk  If Enron has made the decision to sell DealBenchcom and Mr Munk now no longer an Enron employee is able to put together a group to purchase this Internet platform I dont believe that this would constitute a violation of the Conflict of Interests Policy as described in Enrons Code of Ethics It appears that Mr Munk is requesting permission from Enron to move forward with respect to DealBenchcom as described in his letter Please confirm Enrons intentions with respect to DealBench   In addition please advise of any communicationsdiscussions with Mr Munk regarding DealBenchcom and his ability to be a part of DealBenchcom in the event he finds a buyer or becomes part of a group which purchases DealBenchcom

Enron  benefits under our US plans  	Martha Horne  	Isoji David Sato  	Mary Buck  	Daisy Leung  The main reason they were hired through Enron Metals was due to the  fact that a US Henry Bath company had not been set up that could  provide benefits and payroll  Prior to Enrons arrival all Henry Bath  employees were employed by a third party professional employer  organization called Worldtec Group International All other HB  employees continue to be employed and receive benefits from Worldtec  Ive attached some additional information about Worldtec as well as a  copy of the POE Service

28 2001 244 PM To09Lay Kenneth Cc09Davis Sarah A Hope Valeria A Olson Cindy Oxley David Subject09My Redeployment Experience THIS MESSAGE IS PERSONAL  AND CONFIDENTIAL 20 Mr Lay After attending the  All Employee Meeting at The Hyatt on Thursday Aug ust 16th during the QA  period someone sent the comment stating Redeploy ment is a  Joke You commented and stated that if anyone had any questions or  concerns regarding this matter to shoot a e-mail to you and you would respond   After that statement regarding redeployment I felt  compelled to do just what you said-- send a message about my redeployment  experienc e  I am doing this for two reasons 1 to  prevent what has happened to me from the HR representatives side of  redeployment from happening to any  other Enron employee whether redeployment or  any other experience with Enr ons HR reps and  2 to let  you know the redeployment process at Enron is effective and efficient  and two of  the MAIN values of Enron must be exal ted higher   Those values are Communication and  Respect 20 20 I received redeployment from  Enron Broadband Services- Investment grou p on Monday June 18th 2001   Sheila Walton a HR rep spoke to me regardi ng what the process would  entail  During this meeting Sheila mentioned t he redeployment process to  me but discussed and stressed to me more my o ptions  when I departed the company rather than my options to locate anoth er  position with the company not at all promoting the advantage of  redep loyment and its many success stories  With no directions from Sheila  Walt on I took it upon myself to contact Joyce Barrett in the redeployment grou p  for advice and guidance  I met Joyce through a info-luncheon hosted for EBS assistants and the DoubleTree to give information about redeployment  and how  the process works and its successes  Because of a lack of  Commu nication to the redeployment department after a  week I did not have any  information about me going into redeployment  so at the end of the week I had no location for a redeployment desk and I  was leaving my department a t the end of the week of June 18-22  20 20 Due to this lack of  communication I had to take off Monday  Tuesday  June 25th 26th to have  my desk churned and locate a space for me for 45  days  Joyce Barrett  contacted me with a location and more information reg arding my redeployment  process  Located in 3 Allen Center I set-up my se arch for  a new job at Enron and my goal was to do my best to find a job within Enron because that was a opportunity that I felt I owed myself and Enron as a whole by becoming Enron proud and believing in the visions  a nd values  I met with Marie Jensen of Spearion to review my resume  and sh arpen my interview tactics  Joyce  Barrett Michele Hargrave and Brinella  Knight were in contact with me to find  out how my job search was going and lending support in any way   I  had many interviews with companies outsid e and within Enron  An  experience to meet new and interesting people and  a opportunity that I feel  I would have not been able to have without redep loyment so I  have no regrets about being redeployment   I must tell you  that I was afraid because a lot about this process I was unsure of and m y  HR rep did nothing to assure me or inform me that this transition  is on e that can be rewarding as well as a strong  challenge 20 With Enrons values  system Respect Integrity Communication and Exce llence in place and  strongly promoted by you  and Jeff Skilling before hi s  departure I want to stress to you that my experience with the HR side  of  redeployment has NOT carried out the value system that Enron promotes  and Im sure whoever sent the comment about redeployment in that meeting   had every meaning of HR person representing Enron in such a  way that a jo ke is a kind way of putting it No one should be  treated this way   On J uly 31 2001 I took a   temporary position in the Associate  Analyst Prog ram headed by Billy  Lemmons and Traci Warner working with Jeff Davis John Walt and Cathy Lira as  well as supporting the group as a whole  I worked in this department  until  August 21 2001  I received a message from Shi rley Cox  Sheila Waltons assistant inquiring whether or not I had a  posi tion within Enron  I called Shirley back and gave  her information about t he temporary assignment I had taken in the Associate   Analysts Program O n  August 14th a call was made by Sheila  Walton to a Sr Admin in the Ass ociate  Analyst Program  inquiring whether I was working this department The admin passed the  information to Jeff Davis and he contacted Sheila W alton as to where I was  working and how long I had been working in the dep artment  With a  remorseful sounding voice Sheila proceeded to inquiry to Jeff more details to  which Jeff provided her  I had overtime hours that I tried to put into the  system but I was unable to get into the time sys tem  After the  conversation with Jeff Davis and Sheila Walton I  find  o ut Sheila  had started the process to delete me from the system  before my original end date of August  15th   I accepted a permanent position with  Enron Networks as a Admin  Assistant II on August 14 2001 reporting to Sam Leuschen  I started  that position on August 22 2001 On August 24 2001  after 2 days  of employment was terminated from the position and Enron du e to  Business Reorganization in Enron Networks 20 20 I am very concerned about the  way this matter was handled and the seri es of events that surrounded this  action  As a result  I would like to d iscuss with you and or  someone in the responsible capacity and go into fur ther detail   I have received a form letter stating that Enron can termina te my employment at  will at any time and for any reason  I feel this act ion has been provoked  for other reasons20 20 In ending this message to  you Mr Lay you must know that redeployme nt at Enron is  a effective tool that should remain in place  You should a lso know and  commend those persons who work in and closely with the redepl oyment group   Enough good things cannot not be said about those people wh o go  out of their way to get you the help the encouragement the tools yo u need  while facing this process  I realize that a business  decision was made and EBS downfall was a business decision but this matter is  not a  business one  When redeployment takes place the human side of you  feel s omewhat lost hurt and you take it personallyalthough I realize it  was a  business decision  This occurrence was targeted and directed at  me person ally by Sheila Walton Human resources should work with the human  being to make you a better person through visions and values not to be treated  in humanely  Whether they are Enrons values or values in  general HR repres entatives should portray what human  beings should have most of allVALUE S and  when there is no communication no respect no integrity the  jok e begins and excellence is lost 20 I look forward to hearing from  you or someone in your office soon   I can be contacted at the  numbers listed below at any time   Thank you in  advance for the  opportunity to discuss this matter 20 20 20 Sincerely 20 20 Cathy Bates 713 524-2530 home 832 372-6602 cellcbateshoustonrrcom  File mailtocbateshoustonrr com    File mailto0hotmailcom  20 20 20

September 20 2001 403 PM To Cordoza Christina Subject REMilitary Leave Practices Christina   Heres a synopsis of the replies I received from within the firm so far   One Fortune 500 client told a Littler attorney that he had participated in a 100-company conference call about the issue earlier this week The sense he got from the call was that almost every company was planning to pay employees the difference between their normal wages and military base pay exclusive of allowances for a certain period which varied among the companies Many were going to pay for 90 days some for 180 days and a few for a year One of the companies that was opting for 180 days had previously provided a pay differential for 4 weeks   Another attorney was advised by a major energy industry client that it was paying the difference between the military pay and the employees salary for one year   One attorney has spoken to several firm clients over the past few days about this and almost all of them are going to exceed the legal requirements by offering some form of continued compensation but no specifics as to duration   Another Littler lawyer was told by a large industrial client that it would pay the difference between military pay and normal salary and continue benefit coverage with no indication about maximum duration Thomas J Dowdalls Littler Mendelson 2175 N California BlvdSuite 835 Walnut

Pornography issue Michelle I wanted to follow up with some additional information regarding the child porn issue The consensus seems to be that the company does not need to report the child porn if it does not want to  The only exception to this is individuals engaged in an electronic communication service or a remote computing service to the public are obligated under 42 USC 13032 to report child porn to the Cyber Tip Line at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  I looked at the definitions of electronic communication service and remote computing service and the second does not seem to apply although the former could apply  The statute appears to qualify both as providing those services to the public so I would not think an email system for employees would apply  The definition of electronic communication service is pretty broad though  If you want me to investigate this further let me know but I would think we have a good argument that we do not provide these services to the public The child porn statute 18 USC 2252A covers pornography involving girls under the age of 18 so much porn could be child porn  There are enhanced penalties for certain types of child porn and for child porn involving children under the age of 12  There is an affirmative defense under the statute if the possessor of child porn destroys it or reports it to a law enforcement agency  Therefore it seems the best course of action is to destroy anything the company has and there does not appear to be a reporting obligation  Ashley anonymously called the FBI and the DA and their responses are indicated below  The information obtained from the FBI and DAs office is consistent with my recommendations Kerry E Notestine Littler Mendelson PC 1900 Chevron Tower 1301 McKinney Street Houston Texas 77010 7136524748 7139519212 fax knotestinelittlercom wwwlittlercom  -----Original Message----- From	Zimmermann Ashley  Sent	Thursday August 16 2001 400 PM  To	Notestine Kerry  Subject	Child Pornography issue  Kerry  I did a little bit of further research on this issue  First as Brian  King stated simply downloading or making a copy of child pornography for  any reason-even to provide it as evidence to law enforcement- is a crime  in the US so the client should not attempt to copy it  The client  should attempt to obtain the URL Web address and report that information  to law enforcement if the client decides to report it  Second  the statute making it illegal to knowingly receive or distribute  child pornography through interstate or foreign commerce through any  means including by computer or receive or distribute child pornography  that has been received or distributed by someone else through interstate  or foreign commerce in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction  of the United States is 18 USC Section 2252A  It is not clear whether our client has a duty to report the finding of  child pornography on its computer system  42 USC Section 13032 states  that whoever while engaged in providing an electronic communication  service or a remote computing service to the public through a facility or  means of interstate or foreign commerce obtains knowledge of facts or  circumstances from which a violation of sections 2252A involving child  pornography is apparent shall as soon as reasonably possible make a  report of such facts or circumstances to the Cyber Tip Line at the  National Center for Missing and Exploited Chidlren  The number for the  Cyber Tip Line is 1-800-843-5678  Depending upon how you read the above paragraph our client might have a  duty to report its finding child pornography on its computer system to the  Cyber Tip Line despite the fact that it has been unable to determine who  put it on there  For practical advice I contacted the FBI and a Harris  County DA  The FBI duty agent I talked to said that if the company does  not know who put the pornography on there they do not have a duty to  report it  However he suggested that they contact the Field Office in  San Juan Puerto Rico because the office might have certain equipment  specialists etc that could assist the client in determining who put the  child pornography on the system and further investigating the issue  The  phone number for the FBI in San Juan is  787754-6000 and if the client  calls heshe should just ask to speak to a duty agent and explain what  they found and how they found it  Note there is also a special FBI  Office that handles crimes against children that offices number is  202324-3666  Additionally the Harris County DA I talked to was not concerned that it  would be some type of spoliation of evidence to destroy the pornography  and agreed that it is a crime simply to knowingly receive it but  recommended that the client contact the FBI in Puerto Rico so that they  could decide whether they wanted to pursue it before the client destroyed  it  Let me know if you wish me to look into this further  Ashley ----This email may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipients Any review use distribution or disclosure by others is strictly prohibited

Help Employers Enhance Employee  Relations While Minimizi ng Employment  Claims Please forward this  newsletter to your friends and co-workers  To subscri ber or  unsubscribe see bottom of newsletter We at EPS share our grief and prayers with our  fellow Americans in the wak e of the terrorist attacks  We offer our  condolences to those of you who  have lost loved ones friends or colleagues  This tragedy has touched eac h of our lives  While focusing on  business-as-usual is difficult right now  we are moving quickly to  adapt to the needs of our clients We are addin g special segments to our HR  classes to address organizational response an d workers reactions to the crisis  and we will continue to work to meet y our special needs We are committed  to providing a compassionate resource  should you need  one What  NOW Kathleen K Edmond Esq MBA  LICSW Employment  Practices Solutions Senior Consultant MinneapolisSt  Paulke dmondepexpertscom20 800  727-2766 20 Soon very soon we will all need to  get ourselves and our companies back  to business - whether we are ready or  not  How can we do this in a way  t hat is respectful and helpful but at the same time doesnt create issues t hat  do not exist First understand that we  are all affected  Not just those of  us who had family friends co-workers or neighbors in New York Washington or  who were passengers on the airlines   Our world has permanently changed   Th is is not a dramatic overstatement  It is simply the truth  We cannot und o what happened yesterday  but we can influence how we deal with the change and how we can be stronger as a  result of the horrible attack on our coun try our safety and our sense of  security yesterday Let me simply make a  list  I apologize if this is not  Pulitzer Prize mat erial  Timeliness  is the most important factor at the moment 20 Speak to the  organization  Pull management  together first to discuss the ir responsibilities as managers and give them  guidance  Acknowledge their dual  roles as managers in the organization and individuals with personal  feelings  While it will take time  to absorb the full impact of what has  happened it will be necessary to get  back to the business at hand 20 Depending on the size  and configuration of the organization talk to every one as a group  Either get them together in person a  group e-mail voice mail teleconference - whatever means are available to  you  At this point it is most  important to let people know that we are all stunned but that  we are pulling  together  It is not important to  have all the answers rig ht now   Communication will continue 20 Acknowledge that our  world is now different  The sense  of safety and sec urity we had before September 11th is gone  We must each individually and  organizationally replace that with something different 20 Acknowledge that  individuals will respond and recover at different paces  Some will want to get back to work as  quickly as possible to regain their sense of normalcy and control  Others will have difficulty focusing  for  a long time  Most likely it  will be sporadic and not a constant inability to focus  This is a very normal response to a  crisis 20 Depending on your  organization and the level of direct impact you may cho ose to bring a  professional counselor or team of counselors on site for a  day or longer  They can conduct group processes and  individual counseling  20 Another possibility is  a chat room where employees can share their experie nces feelings and have a  place to vent  The question will  arise how l ong should the chat room be operational  For right now dont set a time l imit  but review it in a couple of weeks or a month  If participation is  decreasing which  I except that it will in a month determine a date to c lose it down and make  an organizational announcement to that effect  When closing it down dont go dark  without notice  Just let people  know tha t it is time to end that part of the recovery process 20 Allow people to talk  periodically during the day  The  need for the amoun t of discussion will change over the next weeks  In the next day or so pro bably little  work will get done  But by the  end of the week and certainl y next week business will resume 20 Consider allowing employees additional  personal time off for memorial serv ices blood donations or other  community-focused recovery events 20 Remind people to use  your Employee Assistance Program company counselors health benefits  religious leaders and other local counseling resources  as available  Have someone in the organization pull  together a resource l ist of local and organizational telephone numbers for  employees and their  families 20 Talk about the impact  on your specific business and what effect if any it  has on your company  Maybe it affects your communications  transportation  distribution or some other aspect of your operations 20 If  members of your corporate family have been killed in these attacks con sider a  memorial service later this week or next for all employees to atte nd whether  they personally knew the individuals or not 20 Assure them that  business will go on subdued perhaps different in some w ays but there will  be continuity 20 Recognize that people  will be angry sad scared and confused for some per iod of time  The risk of discriminatory judgments  and remarks is increase d  If you  hear such remarks challenge gently if necessary but help peo ple understand  that it is a normal reaction to the attacks on our safety  20 Remind them to take  care of themselves and their families and friends  It is important to keep talking to  each other and their children even those very young children  Here is a good article they can  use  wwwwomencent ralmsncomparentingarticlestragedyasp20 We do not know what will be happening in the next weeks or  months  There  may be additional  armed conflict  We have entered a  time of uncertainty  that will continue to affect the national psyche and our  individual lives As organizations  we are well advised to be prepared to address the effec t it will have on our  employees You will need to address the corporate travel policy  What will you do if  an employee is  afraid to travel to New York for a business trip  Consider making other meeting  arrangements at least for the near term Longer term you will have questions about what to do with  employees who ca nnot seem to focus after a reasonable length of time  And you will have qu estions about what  is a reasonable length of time and proper disciplinary  actions if needed  We will address those questions as they  arise but for now they are beyond the scope of this communication  Please feel free to  email or call us if  you have specific questions Yesterday I was conducting  a Best  Practices seminar in Minneapolis as the terrorist attacks were  unfolding on the East Coast  As we  did not know  the magnitude of what was about to happen we decided to continue  with the  work in front of us but to be cognizant of the events that were  occurring The day and the response  of the participants were instructive to what to expect at work  Participants were engaged but at some  level distracted We took a break  every hour or so for an update on events   We talked ab out our personal feelings  We changed our agenda to spend the last  half h our of the day planning about how we would lead our organizations through   this tragedy  We discussed the role  of Human Resources and the Legal depa rtments  We wondered at the inconsistency of the  beautiful day the sunsh ine and the green grass in the suburbs of Minneapolis  and the horror we we re hearing on the news  We encouraged people who had two hours  of drive t ime to leave a half hour early to be home with their families  We all took calls and made calls during  the day to check on family and friends In other words we took  care of ourselves and we took care of others  We also worked and planned for the  future  I urge you to do the  same About the  author 20 Kathleen Knutson Edmond is a  Senior consultant with Employment

       the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work -        that I was making jobapplications by company email Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment As a manager Mr Bezanis has -        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval -        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance PRC process which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers and clients by review  Until now Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results -        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an energy index as a potential useful trading instrument  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite but the reaction of Mr Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first  I was banned by him from developing the idea further Discrimination It is our belief that Mr Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees especially competent women as equals  His rough stifling and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms Courtney Campbell the other only woman reporting to him Hostile Working Environment The working environment under Mr Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence  We are managed by threats rather than constructive comments Wrongful Termination Knowing I was unfairly treated Enron HR has not helped address my concerns  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process  Ms Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers no matter how wrong they are  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case Yours sincerely Mingcheng Lian

status  Through affirmative action we seek to establish a level playing field for all employees and applicants regardless of race gender disability or veteran status  We use statistical analyses of employment patterns as indicators of whether the playing field is truly level The AAP contains proprietary information therefore it should not be shared with anyone outside of Enron  If your operating

Please refer to Enrons Code of Ethics book for guidance concerning your obligations of confidence with proprietary company information Although the AAP contains proprietary information and belongs to

regard to race color religion age sex national origin disability or veteran status  All employee selections are based on 1 inclusive recruitment and outreach efforts and the merit qualifications and competence of individuals for the particular positions and 2 consistently providing equal employment opportunity  We believe that a diverse workforce is a strength and that as we implement personnel policies and practices which foster fair treatment on the basis of race sex and disability we promote equitable employment opportunities for all employees and applicants Enron administers all personnel programs and employment opportunities without regard to race color religion age sex pregnancy national origin physical or mental disability veteran status or status as an alien authorized to work in the United States  Such employment programs and opportunities include but are not limited to compensation benefits transfers layoff leaves of absence return from layoff training education tuition assistance and Company-sponsored social and recreational programs We have developed and implemented the 2001 Affirmative Action Program AAP to support our commitment to the principle of equal employment opportunity and meet federal and state requirements  The AAP describes in detail the policies and procedures used in the Companys operations to carry out its commitment Your companys EEO
