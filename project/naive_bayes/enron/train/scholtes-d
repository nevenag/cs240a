company will be the greatest someday But lo and behold it would not come to pass It was all a fraud and scam most would call crass How could it be true we all asked All we do is buy and sell gas But to make their personal billions They had to keep in the dark their minions So they lied and cheated stole and cajoled Analysts investors workers and sold and sold But they found out the scam And put the company in quite a stew They told Ken and Andy we have lost confidence Little did they know that confidence is what cons do The old man in charge said we all trust Andy hes fine He made me my fortune and never charged a dime Andy got paid to manage illegal partnerships you see And for that he collected thirty m illion as his fee But the pressure was on and Ken had to act He told Andy You must go on leave Is he still on the payroll we asked We get no answer Seems Andy will be there to the last Ken restated his books and oh the looks that Were on the faces of all but the crooks The books had been cooked Not one year not two not even three They had been cooked a total of four And many suspect even more He went into the elevator that old gas trader He hit floor fifty where his offices reside With two armed guards standing at his side And so he rose to the top of 1400 Smith And went into the boardroom forthwith There were the ghosts of Fastow and Skilling Where with their cronies they devised great scams How to deceive cheat and steal millions of clams And with one more scam to do He picked up the phone and called his friend Chuck Chuck he said  Im in quite a jam can you please help me I got caught in my scam So old Chuck bit a nd came to Kens side First with some money and took Ken as his bride But that old scoundrel had played too many scams This one he could not hide as Chucks lawyers and guides Went over Kens books and found such a surprise There were no trades there were no counterparties There were no assets there was no Christmas party And so Chuck went to Ken and said Your company Is a sham It was all lies I cannot merge with you Your firm is a rotting carcass festering with flies And so Ken thought He thought and he thought He will file Chapter eleven and fire a lot Four thousand to be exact We thought he has lost gazillions but prior filing he managed to bonus his friends fifty eight Million And so we are told the company will be back A shell of itself but not quite the same The shell is appropriate as we all know The core business of Ken is a shell game
