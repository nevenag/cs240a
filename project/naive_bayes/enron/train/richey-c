clerk a  question As he   turns to go to the front desk he accidentally bumps into a  woman   beside him   and as he does his elbow goes into her breast They are  both startled   and he says Maam if your heart is as soft as your  breast I know   youll   forgive me She replies if your penis is as hard as your  elbow Im   in room 1221      8   A young man walks up and sits down at the bar What can I  get you   the bartender inquires I want 6 shots of Jagermeister  responded the   young man 6 shots Are you celebrating something  Yeah my first   blowjob   Well in that case let me give you a 7th on the house  No offense   sir but if 6 shots wont get rid of the taste nothing  will     7   A businessman boards a flight and is lucky enough to be  seated next to   an absolutely gorgeous woman They exchange brief hellos  and he notices   she is reading a manual about sexual statistics He asks  her about it   and   she replies This is a very interesting book about sexual  statistics   It identifies that American Indians have the longest  average penis and   Polish men have the biggest average diameter By the way  my name is Jill   Whats yours He coolly replies Tonto Kawalski nice to  meet you      6   One night as a couple lay down for bed the husband gently  taps his   wife on the shoulder and starts rubbing her arm The wife  turns over and   says   Im sorry honey Ive got a gynecologist appointment  tomorrow and I   want to stay fresh The husband rejected turns over and  tries to   sleep A   few minutes later he rolls back over and taps his wife  again This time   he whispers in her ear Do you have a dentist appointment  tomorrow too      5   Bill worked in a pickle factory He had been employed there  for a   number of years when he came home one day to confess to his  wife that he had   a   terrible compulsion He had an urge to stick his penis into  the pickle   slicer His wife suggested that he should see a sex  therapist to talk   about it but Bill indicated that hed be too embarrassed  He vowed to   overcome the compulsion on his own One day a few weeks  later Bill came   home   absolutely ashen His wife could see at once that something  was   seriously wrong Whats wrong Bill she asked Do you  remember that I   told   you how I had this tremendous urge to put my penis into the  pickle   slicer   Oh Bill you didnt Yes I did My God Bill what  happened I   got   fired No Bill I mean what happened with the pickle  slicer   Ohshe got fired too      4   A man was visiting his wife in hospital where she has been  in a coma   for several years On this visit he decides to rub her left  breast instead   of just talking to her On doing this she lets out a sigh  The man runs   out and tells the doctor who says this is a good sign and  suggests he   should try rubbing her right breast to see if there is any  reaction The man   goes   in and rubs her right breast and this brings a moan From  this the   doctor suggests that the man should go in and try oral sex  saying he will   wait outside as it is a personal act and he doesnt want  the man to be   embarrassed The man goes in then comes out about five  minutes later   white as a sheet and tells the doctor his wife is dead The  doctor asks   what   happened to which the man replies She choked      3   A guy walks into a bar with a pet alligator by his side He  puts the   alligator up on the bar He turns to the stonished patrons  Ill make   you a deal Ill open this alligators mouth and place my  genitals inside   Then the gator will close his mouth for one minute Hell  then open his   mouth and Ill remove my unit unscathed In return for  witnessing this   spectacle each of you will buy me a drink The crowd  murmured their   approval   The man stood up on the bar dropped his trousers and  placed his privates   in the alligators open mouth The gator closed his mouth  as the crowd   gasped   After a minute the man grabbed a beer bottle and rapped  the alligator   hard on the top of its head The gator opened his mouth and  the man   removed   his genitals unscathed as promised The crowd cheered and  the first of his   free drinks were delivered The man stood up again and made  another offer   Ill pay anyone 100 whos willing to give it a try A  hush fell over   the   crowd   After a while a hand went up in the back of the bar A  woman timidly   spoke up Ill try but
